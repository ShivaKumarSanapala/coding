**[Part-I]** : https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/1464918/Journey-from-4L-to-40L-Life-is-marathon-not-sprint.

First, I would like to congratulate all the folks (90+ in count) who, despite starting as below average in their careers (with WITCH or similar organizations), got inspired by the above post, took action, and secured a good offer. This post is targeted at experienced professionals who are willing to switch.

I am continuing this as many of you requested for an update on my journey. It has been 3+ years since Part 1, and here I am with the second edition, now with a total of 6 years and a few months of experience.

**Sept 2021:** Joined a new organization with a 40L salary. It was relatively a startup, so I had to grind for long hours. Since my past experience wasn\u2019t very strong, I used to dedicate 12+ hours to work almost daily. It was remote due to COVID, so I could invest significant time in my work.

**Dec 2021:** Tried for Google and Microsoft. I cleared Microsoft technical rounds, but the manager declined due to my frequent switches. Google feedback was mixed: 2 strong hire, 1 lean hire, and 1 no-hire. I wasn\u2019t able to practice alongside work and got bored of DSA that year.

**June 2022:** Received a 10% increment, bringing my current salary to around 44L. I started considering a switch as remote work was about to end, and I was feeling homesick. I was tired of the poor work-life balance (WLB). Over the next 4-5 months, I interviewed at many places and received offers from Adobe, PhonePe, Deliveroo, Ethos, LendingKart, and others. I declined Adobe (though it offered good money) as they wanted me to work on a desktop app in C++.

**Dec 2022:** Took a 15-day break and joined a new remote job with 52L in the new year. It was another startup but much better than the last one. Pay wasn\u2019t the main factor; remote work was. To be honest, I was scared of the culture.

I continued working there for 2 years and got a promotion, though it didn\u2019t come with a significant hike (only 10%). The work was awesome\u2014I delivered ~50 features, improved on-call processes, and learned many great things. This was the first time I experienced how you can be efficient even without daily standup meetings. This restored my faith that corporate people can be technically sound and humble at the same time.

**Nov 2024:** Finally left the remote job and moved to a hybrid role with a bigger brand and a tempting & whopping offer of 88-90L. I received an offer from Blinkit for 70-75L but declined it due to its horrible culture and 5-day office policy. Switching out of remote work was a tough choice but necessary as I was falling behind in terms of learning and networking.

[FAQ]:

**1. Did I face challenges switching so many times in my short career?**
Yes, of course. I faced a lot of rejections in screening rounds because of my unstable profile, which gets highlighted at the first glance. I even faced rejection at Microsoft for the same reason, with the manager stating it directly.

**2. How did I get so many interview calls? Where did I apply?**
I did everything to get interview calls: Naukri, Instahyre, LinkedIn DMs, referrals, LinkedIn jobs. It was a mix of all these efforts. I don\u2019t have any magic portals. The remote job was also a coincidence. Influencer posts claiming "Top 10 sites for remote jobs" were of no use to me\u2014don\u2019t fall for that trap.

**3. How did I learn DSA?**
The most frequent question I get is how I learned DSA: I learned during COVID, as shared in my last post. Since 2021, I haven\u2019t practiced much. Posting without anonymity so you can see how little I\u2019ve practiced in the last 4 years. Contests helped me retain my logical thinking for new problems in interviews. My practice tapered off in 2021 and decreased further in 2022-23-24. I plan to improve in 2025.

**4. Resources for System Design?**
I believe everyone knows the resources\u2014ask ChatGPT, and it\u2019ll tell you the same. There are free and paid resources; choose one and stick with it. Don\u2019t switch midway.
For me, as I mentioned in my last post, I prefer books for better concentration. I learned concepts through books (still a work in progress). I fell in love with technical books. I learned system design mostly on the job through code reviews and feedback on architectures I designed.

**5. How did I find time to prepare?**
I used to code early in the morning. That\u2019s why my username reflects this habit\u2014it\u2019s tough for me to work after office hours, as my mind doesn\u2019t function well then. For the 2024 switch, I casually interviewed without specific preparation.

**6. Did I take any academy or paid training?**
Never. I\u2019m not a fan of paid training. You can use them for discipline, but free resources are also sufficient.

**7. Do I mentor people or give paid training to engineers?**
No, I\u2019ve never done personal paid training. I tried a few academies but didn\u2019t like their curriculums (not student-friendly), so I didn\u2019t continue. I\u2019ve helped a few individuals who were proactive but stuck, usually over weekends to solve their coding issues.

**8. Can I reveal my personal info, LinkedIn, or company names?**
No, sorry. I\u2019m uncomfortable sharing these details. Please don\u2019t ask. Maintaining anonymity is tough for me, especially when not posting anonymously. Feel free to ask questions; I\u2019ll answer them.

**9. Is it recommended to switch jobs this frequently?**
No, never. Frequent switches are not good for your profile, it portrays you as unstable. Unfortunately, your next salary is decided by your previous salary. I started with such a low salary that switching was the only way to step-up. Had I started with 6-9L, I would not have switched so often.

**10. My tech stack and years of experience?**
I have 6.5 years of experience. My tech stack has been primarily Java microservices backend with Kafka, REST, and gRPC. I\u2019m open to other backend systems as well (tech-agnostic).

**11. What\u2019s the significance of this post?**
Some might call this show-off, but I\u2019m not an influencer or trying to sell courses. I\u2019m sharing this because I\u2019m one of you, believing 30-40L is the end goal. My earning target in college was 30-35L, but life took threw in some surprises. The harder you work, the luckier you get!

**12. When should you look at the solution to a coding problem?**
There are two phases for every topic: learning and practice. During the learning phase, feel free to look at solutions and understand them (try brute force if you can). In the practice phase, avoid looking at solutions immediately. If you have a clue, try coding or dry running your solution. Don\u2019t jump to solutions directly.

Clearing misconceptions from my DMs:

*  *This journey was smooth and easy.* **No, it was tough** Even today, if I apply to 40-50 companies on LinkedIn/Naukri, I get one recruiter call, which often ends with ghosting. It\u2019s a devastating feeling. Rejections from big companies were significant disappointments.
*  *You must be living a great life.* Not really. My in-hand salary is much less after taxes and other deductions. I gained weight, lost touch with friends, and barely traveled.
* Hopefully, in 2025, I\u2019ll get back in shape and find someone to move to the next phase of life with Bhagwan ji\u2019s blessings.
* There are folks earning far better than me, with deeper knowledge. I\u2019m still a beginner, not an expert.
* I\u2019m not familiar with front-end, data science, or AI roles, so I can\u2019t share opinions on them. My experience is limited to QA manual, support, and backend dev positions.

***It\u2019s never too late to hit a few sixes in life!***

Discipline beats motivation. If you\u2019re motivated, start solving one question daily in 2025, and share your offers with me\u2014I love seeing dreams fulfilled.
Wish you all a very happy 2025 !!

- **Tags:** Deliveroo, Interview

I interviewed at Deliveroo in Nov 2024.

**Round 1:** Introductory call with their recruiter first.
**Round 2:** coding challenge to do on Hackerrank, which had MCQs and a few Android coding question.
**Round 3:** Take home assignment which took longer than 3hrs that they mentioned.
**Round 4:** Pair Programming. This went almost on a made-it level. I got the main task done but made a lot of typo mistakes and took a hint too. But I got a call for the HM round so I assumed I passed this one.
**Round 5:** HM. this one went well from what I felt. But when the interviewer said he worked on his last company for 10 yrs and then later asked me to explain my switches, i got a judgy tone like he didn\'t even want to hear my side. But he continued and expressed all is good. This was typical behavioural round, nothing tricky and just discussion. though he was waiting every few mins to type my response on his doc. Anyone would think this was obv a pass, but next day I got a rejection mail with no specific feedback or a reason?? I contacted the recruiter, he never responded. Disappointing from a company like Deliveroo. It felt too unfair! If you are going to test us with soo many rounds and waste our time, at least give a reason if you want to reject. Why just ghost like this?

### 9. [Deliveroo | SSE(L5) | Hyderabad | Rejected Offer L4](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6004996/deliveroo-ssel5-hyderabad-rejected-offer-qo7p)


# Deliveroo | SSE(L5) | Hyderabad | Rejected Offer L4

- **Updated at:** Nov 30, 2024 at 06:19 PM
- **Tags:** Deliveroo, Interview

Status - I was downleveled and offered L4. Rejected the offer as downlevel did not made sense.

I recently completed the interview process for Deliveroo and wanted to share my experience. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the process and some tips that might help future candidates:

**1. Online Assessment (OA)**

The OA consisted of three sections:

**Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**

This section included questions on distributed systems, databases, REST, and other related topics.

**Section 2: Coding Challenge**

This involved implementing a variation of a rate limiter. The problem was of LeetCode medium difficulty level.

**Section 3: API Implementation**

In this part, I was tasked with making an API call and performing basic filtering and sorting operations on the returned data.

**2. Take-Home Assignment**

After passing the OA, I received a take-home assignment to build a basic cron parser. The key to this task was to write clean, readable, and extendable code using appropriate design patterns. This assignment aimed to evaluate not just the functionality but also the code structure and maintainability. Also make sure to write unit test cases.

**3. Interview Rounds**

After submitting the take-home assignment, HR contacted me to schedule two interview rounds based on my availability. Here\u2019s how these rounds went:

**Round 1: System Design**

**Task**: Design a system to handle 6 million burger claims within 10 minutes.

**Tips**:

* Clearly communicate your design choices and avoid making assumptions without discussing them.
* Include relevant aspects such as monitoring, logging, and failover strategies.
* Cover scalability, load balancing, and database design in detail.
* Engage with the interviewer and walk them through your thought process.

**Round 2: Coding Round**

**Task**: Extend the initial cron parser assignment.

I managed to implement three extensions and provided a high-level approach for a fourth before time ran out.

Tips:

* Be familiar with the syntax of the language you are using.
* Limit the number of hints you take from the interviewer; showcase your problem-solving skills.
* Propose multiple test cases from your end and dry-run the code before using debug statements.
* Debug logs should be a last resort if you encounter persistent issues.

**Round 3. Behavioral Interview**

The final round was a behavioral interview, where we explored my past projects in-depth. The format was centered around "**Tell me about a time when\u2026**" questions.

Common Themes:
* Mentorship experiences
* Conflict resolution
* Managing and prioritizing tasks


The questions asked are readily available all over the internet, and the interviewers were friendly, resulting in an overall positive experience.
I hope this helps those preparing for interviews with Deliveroo. Good luck!

- **Created at:** Oct 31, 2024 at 06:31 PM
- **Updated at:** Oct 31, 2024 at 06:31 PM
- **Tags:** Deliveroo, Interview

**OA (Hackerrank)**
* MCQ questions on Distributed systems/REST API/ DB etc
* 1 coding question Leetcode Medium difficulty -  Variation of rate limiter
* 1 Problem on fetching and filtering data from an api

**Take Home Assignment**
Once the OA is cleared, HR sent the take home assignment, a cron parser. Make sure your code adhered is readable, extensible(make sure to use relavent coding design patterns).Also, make sure to add unit tests, basic documentation.

Once I submitted the assignment, got a call from HR to schedule two virtual onsite rounds i.e coding & design architecture.

**Round 1**
This was design round, was asked to design a system which can give away 6M burgers in 10 mins of time.

Make sure to discuss about tradeoffs at each step and decision you take also make sure to properly include and talk about relavent alerts & monitoring for the system.

**Round 2**
This was the coding round, was asked to implement 3 more extension and for the fourth one was asked to give approach only as time was not left.
Make sure to test your code with multiple test cases, also don\'t directly use print log for debugging, first try to debug via reading code and then after that put debug logs if needed.

After this the third round was scheduled for Behavioural interview

**Behavioural Round**

Deep dive on past experience.
Tell me about a time when
* mentored a junior
* had a conflict within team
* make short-term sacrifices for long-term gains.

Status: Awaiting result

1. Message Delivery System
   In this task, a basic message delivery service is to be implemented that has a rate-limiting algorithm that drops any message that has already been delivered in the last k seconds.

Given the integer k, a list of messages as an array of n strings, messages, and a sorted integer array timestamps representing the time at which the message arrived, for each message report the string "true" if the message is delivered and "false" otherwise.

Example:
Suppose n = 6, timestamps = [1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14], messages = ["hello", "bye", "bye", "hello", "bye", "hello"], and k = 5.

Timestamps\tMessage Delivered
1\t                 Hello\t\ttrue
4\t                 Bye\t\ttrue
5\t                 Bye\t\tfalse
10\t               Hello\t  true
11\t               Bye\t\t   true
14\t              Hello\t\t  false

here was my code it failed 2 test case out of 15 ,really no idea where it failed
```
def getMessageStatus(timestamps, messages, k):
    message_last_sent_map = {}
    message_delivered_ack = []

        else:

            if timestamp - last_sent_time >= k:
                message_last_sent_map[message] = timestamp

Position: SSE
Location: Bengaluru
Date: June 2024
YOE: 8+ 

**HR Phone Screen**
HR explained the details of this role and asked all the general screening questions like work experience, reason for switch, compensation, location etc. At the end of the call HR detailed about the interview process and shared a link for an online assessment.

**Online Assessment**
Hackerrank test
 - MCQ on Distributed Systems/REST API/Database/Cache
 - 1 LC Medium
 - 1 Problem on fetching and filtering data from an api

**Take Home Assignment**
Once the OA is cleared, HR sent the take home assignment, a cron parser, suggests not to spend more than 3 hours, language agnostic. Make sure your code is extensible *(If you like the code you wrote, then it is time to submit it)*.

I called HR to let him know that I submitted, so that he can let me know about the next steps at the earliest. HR then sent a link to provide time slots spread around two weeks for two interviews.

Got both the interviews scheduled at once(multiple days)

**Virtual Call 1(One hour)**
This is a coding round, in which interviewer is more interested in the approach that is taken to solve the take home assignment. Interviewer then asked to implement two more extensions, at the end we tested the code in console with different test cases(try to come up with test cases yourself and ask if interviewer has any special test case in their mind that they would like to test).

**Virtual Call 2(One hour)**
This is a system desing round. They asked to design a system which can give away 6M burgers in 10 mins of time.

After a couple of days got another email requesting for availability for the behavioural round.

**Behavioural Round(One hour)**
Deep dive on past experience.
Tell me about a time, when
- you had a challenging time in your project and how you had overcome it.
- you mentored your junior.

Overall the experience was smooth, interviewers are sensible, not very difficult but a good preparation can help you present the solution well.

Update: Got a call from HR, there is strong hire from coding and architectural round, but the feedback from behavioural round is not so great and the hiring committee is not happy with it. So, it is a reject for now.

1. Password problem. Given few conditions determine if password is strong or weak.
2. Don\'t rember exactly but was something like siliding window time problem.

Verdict- Selected

Got all 3 rounds scheduled together

Round 1:- Coding
Given a take home task(Cron parser). Then in the interview asked to implement few features. Overall interview went good, I was able to update the code with all the requested feature.

Round 2:- Managerial
General manager discussion. I answered properly with scenarios but the guy was not that technically sound so he was not able to understand properly. So i think I won\'t get good feedback for this.

Round 3:- HLD
Build a system to distribute 6 million free burgers in ~10 minutes. I used distributed counter with standard queuing mechanism to solve the problem.They asked questions mostly about scalability as the design was mostly simple. The interviewer at the end were satisfied.

Awaiting final results. I think if I get rejected it will be mostly because of the managerial round, after all that round is all about luck.

I would like to share my interview experience for the iOS engineer India location as I haven\'t found any for my preparation. 

**Rounds**: 
**Problem solving**: 
\tSimple data structure-based question, I have been given a dictionary and an array. I was asked to filter items of dictionary based on array to create a menu for restuarant. There was no complex algo question we see usually in problem solving round.

Once we have cleared PS round we will enter in their loop interviews: 
1. **Take home task and Code review**: 
\tA PR was provided and I had to review it and put comments. And a simple task to create a list of similar movies as an extension task. 
2. **Behavioural round**: 
\tTell me a time when you faced a lacking colleague? What did you do? 
\tTell me a time you worked on something complex? How did you do it?
\tTell me a time you added something new to your org? What was the pros and cons?
3. **Architecture Round**: 
\tDesign a delivery architecture for a rider, screens will be provided. You\'re expected to design ent-to-end flow, UI components, API endpoints and responses, design patterns
4. **Extended Take home task**: 
\tYou will be asked to explain your take-home task, anything you would add or remove to the current project and why. 
\tThen you will be asked to find a subtle bug in a block of code from the same project and questions will be asked to fix it. Mine was, there are multiple search requests getting fired, so the data we receive may not be for the latest query, how to fix this data issue?


You need a bit of luck with the behavioral round as the person will judge you for something you can\'t prepare. A clueless person will ruin this round for you. The rest of the rounds are purely based on your knowledge and experience.

Design a system which can handle giving out 10 million free burgers.Each user can claim only one burger and the event should last for only 1 hour?
My thoughts-
1. We can have a UserClaimed table.In which we will store the userId,claimTime,noOfTimesClaimes(for extensibility) etc.Whenever a new user comes will just see the count from this table.
2. We need consistency,here as all the nodes should see the same data othewise we won\'t be able to search the table correctly or have a limit of 10 million burgers.
3. I think we need some kind of a lock here on the count of the burgers.But I am confused about how and where to put this lock?
4. Just a thought - We can have a burgers table which will contain 10 million rows of burgers.Having isClaimed flag and we can take a lock on a row of this table.But I think its not the best solution.

Any thoughts/help you guys have?
