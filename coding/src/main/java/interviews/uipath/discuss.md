Hi, I recently interviewed for a mid level Software Engineer role at UIPath, sharing my experience below, in total there were 3 rounds, and it was a single day drive.

[Round 1] : **DSA : 1 Hour**
- [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands)
- [Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii)

Expectation was to come up with working solution, provide the time and space complexity.

[Round 2] : **DSA : 1 Hour**
- [Power Subsets without duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/description/)
- [Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/description/)

[Round 3] : **LLD : 1 Hour**
- Design a *peer to peer* expense tracking system, similar to splitwise but excluding the groups functionality.

Expectation in this round was simply to mention the design patterns to use and a basic layout of the whole structure, took me some time to understand the peer-to-peer concept here.

Interviewers were friendly and were focused more on understanding the approach to a solution rather than the solution itself, overall nice experience interviewing.

- **Updated at:** Sep 10, 2024 at 10:11 AM
- **Tags:** Microsoft, Salesforce, Atlassian, Wayfair, Stripe, Goldman Sachs, UiPath, PhonePe, Interview

Education: B.Tech NIT
Years of Experience: 6
Prior Experience: MNC. Impacted by Layoff (> 6 months)

Was Impacted by Layoffs in First week of March. Took > 6 Months to land offers. Sharing Month wise preparation and interview experiences.

[Sharing again as the previous post is not accessible]

**March-April** **(*The initial burst of Motivation*)**

The news came as a shock to me and took couple of days to even register what actually happened. Started doing LC on a daily basis with occasional Design questions(HLD).
Started applying from 2nd/3rd week of march, got a couple of calls but couldnt make it past the initial stages.
Was still very confident to close out the job hunt in 6-8 weeks.

**Phonepe**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5058789/phonepe-sde2-bangalore-55yoe [Reject]
Interviewed for **Arista Networks** but there were a lot of questions around Netwokring, hence couldnt clear it.[Reject]
Appeared for OA of **New Relic**, cleared the test and was asked to travel to a different city for in person interviews. Sadly i was going home at that time for Holi and asked the recruiter if its possible to reschedule it to next week to which she agreed. But tried reaching out to her multiple times the following week and didnt get any response.

Wasnt getting as many calls from recruiters as i expected earlier. Since i had very recently switched to the last company, my profile was not even getting shortlisted due to frequent job changes.

Started to lose confidence because of lack of responses.

**May (*The Ghosting Phase*)**

Thats when i started to feel a bit(more) anxious. Till now only a couple of people around me knew about my job status as was too embarrassed to share it with my friends/family.

Started to get some responses from companies. Recruiter screens were getting scheduled but when i joined, no one attended the meeting. Inspite of Multiple followups on mails and on calls, didnt get a single response back from them.
**OCI** scheduled a recruiter pre screen and never showed up.

**Microsoft** Recruiter reached out for a hiring drive, got my availability, didnt get any invite. Tried reaching out to the recruiter and via some friends internally as well, was updated that the interview will be scheduled the following week, nothing happened again.
This happened 2-3 times and eventually i never got any invite for the interview.

Was paralelly appearing for whatever Online Assessments i was getting from Microsoft or any other companies but even after clearing the tests, i wasnt getting any responses.

By the Second week of May, started to maintain streaks on daily questions on Leetcode and was more motivated than ever.

Dont remember if i gave any substantial interviews during this period.

**June (*The month of Realization*)**

Kept on maintaining the streaks till June Mid.

Gave a few interviews:
**Microsoft**:  https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5338820/microsoft-hiring-drive-june-7-bangalore [Reject]
Never got any update from the recruiter. All i ever got was "***We are still waiting for the feedback***" for months.

But still nothing seemed to be working out. Either i was somehow being put up with some unrealistic hard questions in interviews or i just messed up big time.

Again got Ghosted by couple of Companies.

1. **Coackroach Labs** recruiter sync was scheduled, was recheduled multiple times but the recruiter never showed up.
2. Was shortlisted for **Zepto** drive and some other companies, never received any invites.
3. Cleared Online assessment for **Salesforce**, got the call from recruiter for an in person interview in bangalore in next couple of days but sadly i was in my hometown at that time. Requested to have the interview a few days later as it wasnt possible to travel back, but got no response even after multiple followups.

I am no expert on the definition of depression but i didnt have anything to look forward to for the next day, started being in my own shell, didnt feel like sleeping at nights  since didnt want to face another day of applying for jobs and getting rejection mails. Stopped caring about myself, stopped talking to people, stopped enjoying anything and everything around me. Lost track of what day of the week it is. Thought about going to therapy multiple times but being jobless for months didnt go well with my finances so i guess it just felt like a waste of money.

Towards mid of June took some mental break, went on a solo trip, spent some time with family (pretending to work infront of them).

**July** (***Mixed***)

Had sever mental breakdowns towards end of June and first week of July.
First couple of weeks were spent in trying to analyze whats going wrong and where can i improve myself. Was seeing people around me getting jobs in 4-6 weeks after starting to apply for jobs which again made me lose my confidence even more and question myself.

*Still kept on lying to my friends\' questions "How\'s work going?" with a smile on my face.*

Again appeared for Microsoft interviews in an attempt to clear it this time, sadly, it was worse than last time. Got rejected after first round itself.
**Microsoft** : https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5465329/microsoft-sde2-bengaluru-drive-10-july [Reject]

By the 3rd week of July, started getting a few calls from recruiters and had a few initial syncups, exploratory, tech screen rounds.
Stepped up on the preparation even more.

**August-Sept** (Well, Finally!!!)

Gave up on everything (sleep, workout, hanging out with friends, movies, deactivated Instagram, limited my Phone screen time). Was feeling mentally and physically exhausted on a daily basis with just a few hours of sleep.
Fortunately, i had started to plan every day hour wise in order to accomodate interview schedules. Started giving 10+ interviews on a weekly basis and drives on the weekends (appeared for even more than 17 rounds of interviews a few weeks)

Things started to happen at OCI. Yes there were some places where i could have done better but was still looking forward to an offer as overall the interviews went good. But sadly received rejection. This took a heavy toll on me but just somehow pushed myself to not crib about it prepare for the other upcoming interviews.

**OCI** - https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5758958/OCI-or-SMTS-or-6-Years-or-Reject [Reject]
**Microsoft** - Cleared initial OA and first 3 rounds, things messed up in the Hiring Manager round. [Reject]
Ghosted by **ServiceNow** and **PayPal**

Other Interview experiences during this period(Aug-Sept)-

**Wayfair**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5756032/Wayfair-or-L3-or-Bangalore-or-Offer
**Adyen**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5757749/Adyen-or-Java-Backend-or-Bangalore-or-Reject [Reject]

**Goldman Sachs**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5756181/Goldman-Sachs-or-VP-or-Bangalore-or-Offer-or-6-Years
**Salesforce**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5757562/Salesforce-or-SMTS-or-Offer-or-6-YOE
**AngelOne**: Rejected after round 2 [Reject]
**Stripe**: Cleared initial screening round. Rejected in virtual onsites [Reject]
**Zynga**: Rejected in first round [Reject]
**UIPath**: Rejected after second round [Reject]
**Allen**: Rejected after Round 2 [Reject]

Got the first offer from Wayfair but somehow just wanted to get something better considering the negative reviews around the company.
Eventually in the last week of August and first week of september got Offers from *Atlassian, Goldman Sachs and Salesforce* as well.

***Purpose of this Post?*** : Someone out there might be in the same boat as me and might be losing hope as i did multiple times. And a reminder to self as well to not lose hope.
***My suggestion?*** : Keep pushing! Eventually things will fall into place and your hard work will payoff. You will get what you deserve. Sometimes all you can do is keep working hard and do the hardest possible thing: **WAIT!**
To the jobs I applied in march/April, i was getting responses in July. I hate to say this but sometmes, yes luck can definitely be a big factor when it comes to job hunt.
Life is uncertain and more often than not things wont go even remotely close to how you planned them out. I had a lot of plans financially this year, everything just went down the drain. But this wont stop me from dreaming big and planning for my future.

***What kept me going through this period?*** : Guess i am someone who tries to find something positive out of every situation. Always thought *"I am gonna smile with a sense of pride when i make it past this phase and look back at it"*. Always thought about how this phase would make me a better person and how this would make me mentally stronger than ever.
Had weeks where i didnt have anything to look forward to, no interviews, no responses, so just kept pushing myself in the GYM. That sense of progress towards the end of every week in the gym did give me some relief.
Resorted to journaling, reading non-fictional books to keep myself sane through this period.
I am not an exceptional coder/developer. So tried working on my basics, even if i couldnt solve LC hard questions, kept on solving the medium/easy ones multiple times.
Leetcode community has been really helpful to me in my preparation, this collated list of interview experiences is just my attempt to give something back to the community.

Question like multiple writes happening for an actions trades off. It was not the experience like study in leetcode or utube. It was different.

**Round 4**
It was the LLD round. The question was to design the ATM machine. But exptectation was not clear It was vry ambigous in terms of question the interviewer was asking.

Got this question along with balanced parentheses in the online assessment, any idea what problem is similar to this one below?

**Development Team Threshold**

A software company is currently made up of several teams with a certain number of employees in each team. A new policy is being implemented where the percentage Of senior developers in the teams needs to be at or above a certain threshold.
The company wants to hire new senior developers and place them into teams where needed so that this requirement is met for the company. Given the number Of employees and senior developers in each team, as well as the threshold percentage, how many senior developers does the company need to recruit?

For example, let\'s say that there is n 1 team, where teams [2, 5], and the threshold percentage requirement is r 60. The variable teams denote that there are 2 senior developers in a team that has a total size of 5. Initially, the percentage of senior developers in the team is 40% (2/5), but the following occurs as senior developers are hired and added to the team:
- With the first hire. the percentage rises to 3 / 6 \u2014 50%
- With the second hire, the percentage rises to 4 / 7 \u2014 57.14%
- With the third hire. the percentage rises to 5 / 8 \u2014 62.5%

At this point, the threshold requirement of 60% has been met. Therefore, the answer is 3 because that is how many senior developers the company needs to hire in accordance with the new policy.

Note: The percentage does not apply to individual teams but rather an average Of all the teams. Each team has equal weight, so they must first be normalized to a common total score before calculating the percentage. For example, if senior developers make up 100% Of one team and 50% Of another, the total percentage is calculated as 75%.

Function Description
Complete the function hireSeniorDevs in the editor below. hireSeniorDevs has the following parameters:
int `teams[n][2]`: a 2-dimensional array of integers where ith the element contains two values, the first one denoting `senior[i]` and the second denoting `total[i]`
int `r`: the percentage of senior developers there needs to be in the teams
Returns:
int: the minimum number of senior developers the company needs to hire to meet the threshold `r`

**Status:** 4 years experience
**Position:** SDE-II


**Round 1 :** https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-a-large-maze/

**Round 2:**   Rank of all elements in an array
Given an array of N integers with duplicates allowed. All elements are ranked from 1 to N in ascending order if they are distinct. If there are say x repeated elements of a particular value then each element should be assigned a rank equal to the arithmetic mean of x consecutive ranks.

```
Input : 20 30 10
Output : 2.0 3.0 1.0

Input : 10 12 15 12 10 25 12
Output : 1.5, 4.0, 6.0, 4.0, 1.5, 7.0, 4.0

Explanation:
10 is the smallest and there are two 10s so  take the average of two consecutive ranks  1 and 2 i.e. 1.5 .
Next smallest element is 12.  since, two elements are already ranked, the  next rank that can be given is 3. 
However, there  are three 12\'s so the rank of 2 is (3+4+5) / 3 = 4.
Next smallest element is 15. There is only one 15  so 15 gets a rank of 6 since 5 elements are ranked. 
Next element is 25 and it gets a rank of 7.

Input : 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 60, 3
Output : 1.5, 3.5, 6.0, 3.5, 1.5, 7.0, 5.0
```

**Round 3** :   Behavioural Questions

**Round 4:** Design a chat server for group chat and implement API to deliver eventual consistency data model

**Round 5:**  Relevance Score Calculator
Given an array of strings calculate the relevancy score for each pair of string in the array.

```
input:  {"abcd", "dab", "ba"}
output: {2, 1, 1}

Explanation:  
Compare pairs "abcd" and "dab" first in these 2 strings, maximum length of consicutive elemnts is 2 i.e ab 
note that we only want to calculate the score for consicutively matching characters so
dab -> d, a, b, da, ab 
if we check the above substrings with the string "abcd" then  "ab" is the matching substring with largest length for 
this pair so the score is 2 for the 1st pair.

For "abcd" and "ba" the max score is 1 since 
ba -> b, a 

Similarly, for "dab" and "ba" max relevancy score is 1 as there are no 2 consicutive letters in any substrings.
