Hi!

I wanted to know what is expected in System Design in a recent graduate role. I have heard most companies only do it for SWE 2 and above.

I have never been in a System Design interview before so I would be grateful for any kind of information related to Wayfair.

I applied to Wayfair SDE-2 Frontend role on March and will share the whole process of my interview journey.

## Hackerrank Online coding test

After applying I received a online coding test link from hackerrank. There was two questions one was regarding to React and one plain javascript. I forgot the questions. but it was easy and medium leveled. I think the javascript side question was to create something like a Observer pattern or some EventEmitter kind of question.

## Technical Round - 1 : Machine Coding

So after the online test, 15 days later I got a call from the recruiter and scheduled the machine coding interview round. The interviewer was a senior manager and I was given a hackerrank link. There was a full react application.
- **Task 1**
  there were some reviews and there was a select filter. in the select filter there was differenct kind of filters, based on user selection the reviews will get filtered.
- **Task 2**
  debugging and fixing a performance issue for editing one review.

The interview went good and the interviewer was also very helpful.

## Technical Round - 2 : System Design

On the system design round, I was given a link where I saw a ecommerce product details page and asked to give a high level architecture of that page.

In this round, I had to discuss requirments, rendering approach, architecture, data flow and also data schema (for example how the interface of the product will look like), follow up questions and also Optimizations.

This round went good also but I think I could have done it more better. On the Product component which could have make it more scalable and also on the optimizations part. The interviewer was very good, I enjoyed this conversation. Also he asked a question which basically tests your leadership for a project on which I was a little bit confused.

## Hiring Manager Round

The recruiter called me after the system design round and asked me to come to the Wayfair office and give two back to back interviews for Hiring Manager and HR Round.

For the hiring manager, The interviewer asked me many situational based question which I answered based on STAR Pattern. on the end of the interview he asked about what methodology we follow and I dont know what happened to me, I was blank 😭😭 and fumbled.

It was a decent interview, but I understood he was not satisfied 🥲.

## HR Round

After the hiring manager, the hr came and ask general hr questions like why are you looking out, why Wayfair, notice period, compensation.

Verdict - Rejected!

After 1 week the hr called me and told me that they are not moving forward with me 🥲. Only the online test is elimination round. The hr said until a round was that bad, they will not reject in the middle. A canidate have to go through all the rounds and process then they will declare the result.

I hope it helps. Thanks.
(P.S - The hiring manager also asked why are you looking out?)

Hey Guys,

I recently interviewed for the SE-2 (Frontend) role at Wayfair. I was reffered by an employee.

Round 1 - Hackerank test-

1) There was already code written for a timer with UI. There was one button to reset . The requirement was as soon as the page loads the timer should start and should reset if the button is clicked.

2) A very basic JS problem which just needed a single loop (Dont remember the exact question)

Got the call from the recruiter about a week later to schedule the interview.

Round 2 - Machine coding round

This round also had pre written code for a review page (page where users write review about the product)

task 1 -
There is a sort option for review based on - Latest , most liked etc and I had to implement the logic. The challenging part here was to use a useContext and reducer setup as store and to navigate among different files to make changes.

Task 2-

It was to improve the performance of the text area used to write review. initially they were updating store instantaneously when anything was being typed. Had to move it to state variable and update to store on only clicking the save button

Round 3- HLD

I was given the figma mock up for a product detail view page
(sample-  [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/noise-icon-2-1-8-display-bluetooth-calling-women-s-edition-ai-voice-assistant-smartwatch/p/itm968c523d99eae?pid=SMWGEH7VNGPYN5NV&lid=LSTSMWGEH7VNGPYN5NVEORYD7&marketplace=FLIPKART&store=ajy&srno=b_1_2&otracker=browse&fm=organic&iid=en_3d0CqPk_SAGwnPFGN0BX7iZA0zhSEZSvjzyhZTuB8oFtRKA0V5tigYS8d5TeXc7NK-txWLFXOsYDT6Vb6IDiQg%3D%3D&ppt=hp&ppn=homepage&ssid=d52wc7vve80000001746352100316) )

The interviewer was very interactive and we went through the component heirarchy , APIs used , optimisations etc.

I followed the [Frontend Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/@FrontEndEngineer) model of system design and it went very well.

Round 4 - Mangerial round

Basic managerial round with focus on previous work and projects.
Few behavioural questions all standard related to complex technical problem faced, handling bad feedbacks etc

Round 5 - HR round

Similiar behavioural questions

Post this after about 2 weeks I got the verdict as selected.

Hello all,
I recently appeared for the SDE-3 interviews at Wayfair and wanted to share my experience.

**Round 1**
Coding (HackerRank)

Duration:
1 hour

Questions:
I don’t remember the exact questions, but here’s a general overview:
1. The first question was fairly straightforward. It involved string parsing followed by either switch-case or if-else logic.
2. The second question was a simple two-pointer based problem.

Verdict:
Positive

**Round 2**
LLD

Duration:
1 hour

Questions:
Design a bike rental system. The requirements were straightforward, though there were several of them. For example, the system should be able to return the number of bikes currently rented. There were a couple of follow-up questions as well.

Verdict:
Positive

**Round 3**
HLD

Duration:
45 minutes

Questions:
Design Shazam.
Some background here: This round was a bit frustrating. The interview was rescheduled multiple times due to the interviewer’s unavailability. When it finally happened, it seemed like the interviewer hadn't reviewed the official Shazam paper, which led to a few disagreements about how the audio-matching algorithm works. Still, I managed to complete the design and incorporate all the given requirements.

Verdict:
I followed up with HR multiple times. Each time, the HR seemed to have no idea who I was or what stage my interview process was at. I received vague responses like "the interviewer is out of India" or "I'll get back to you." Eventually, I was told that both the LLD and HLD rounds were not up to the mark. Specifically, for HLD, it was mentioned that “a lot of hand-holding” occurred. Seriously??
I had thoroughly prepared the Shazam design using multiple resources, including the official paper. In the LLD round, I finished early, answered every follow-up question and the interviewer seemed pretty satisified. At this point, I genuinely don’t know if they were wasting my time or if I’m being delusional.

I applied to Wayfair through Instahyre and recruiter reached out on my mobile.

#### Background:
YOE: 2.5 years, Currently working at a PBC

#### Round 1 : Online Assessment on HackerRank (50 min)

This consisted of two DSA problems.
1. Question based on String anagrams
1. Question based on BFS on Grids

#### Round 2 : Machine Coding on HackerRank (1 hour)

Recruiter mentioned to me that this would be DSA round, but it turned out to be Machine Coding round instead.

The problem was based on an E-commerce application, where I had to implement cart functionality with discounts etc. I wrote the core logic but missed some edge cases, and was not able to pass the test cases within time.


**Received a rejection mail within a week. Each round is an elimination round.**

Offer Details:
**Target**
Total compensation: 41 LPA(including 10 % bonus)
Standard target benifits

**Wayfair**
Total compensation: 58 LPA(Fully Fixed)
Standard Wayfair benifits

Can you please share your insights on both companies? My priority is work-life balance > technology > compensation. Based on reviews, Target seems to have generally positive feedback, while opinions on Wayfair are more mixed. Additionally, Wayfair's business appears to be on a downward trend.

I interviewed for Google in Dec 24-Jan 25

**Screening Round**
Question: Their are few students who see a sequence written on the black board. They are remember parts of the sequence. You need the verify if the sequence remembered by the students is feasible or not.
Example 1
sequence_part_1 = [2,3,4,5]
sequence_part_2 = [3,5,9]
sequence_part_3 = [2,9]
Output: Valid
Example 2
sequence_part_1 = [2,3,4,5]
sequence_part_2 = [3,5,9]
sequence_part_3 = [9,4,11]
Output: In-Valid
[Note: these are not the exact testcases provided]
My Solution: After running throught the test-cases, it became evident to me that this is just a simple cycle detection problem.
Result: Positive

**1st Onsite**
Question: Given an array tasks, where tasks[i] denote the start time after which a task can be started. Find min time taken to complete the tasks, when you are given S machines and each mahine takes T time to complete a task. One machine cannot be assigned new task if it is already working on some task.
Example:
tasks = [3,3,2,1]
S = 2
T = 2
My Solution: Seemed easy-medium to me. Solved it using sorting and two-pointer (fixed sliding window whatever you want to call)
Result: Positive

**2nd Onsite**
Question: Same question: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/4820505/Google-question/
My solution: Tried a recurssive approach, interviewer wanted something else.
Result: Not-positive

**3rd Onsite**
Standard Gooliness round
Result: Positive

**4th Onsite**
Question: You have a n*(n-1) matrix consisting of 0s and 1s. Find out if there is a path from top-left to bottom-right corner where the number of zeros and ones along the path is same. You can visit the same tile multiple times.
My Solution: This question was quite tricky since you can travel to each cell multiple times.
There are two part to this solution:
1. Check if there adjecent 0\'s or 1\'s, because if so there will exist a path with has equal 0\'s and 1\'s since the matrix is n*(n-1).
2. if not then check all paths while visiting the cells only once.
   Result: Not-positive: Solved this with a lot of hints.

Overall rejected.

Got rejected by Wayfair recently. Wanted to share my experience.

**Process**:
* OA - 2 DSA questions
  \t* an n * m maze. Moved from top left to bottom right. Each move you can take upto k steps. Find minimum number of moves.
  \t\t* Solution is straight forward BFS.
  \t * Don\'t remember the second question, but it was easy.
* Interview - Coding round
  \t* Q1: Coupons and categories they work on are given. Categories are heirarchial and parent category coupons work for child categories. For a given category find the nearest coupon can than be applied.
  \t * Q2: Coupons have a datetime. Optimize the algo such that latest datetime coupons wins.
* Interview - Low Level Design
  \t* The infamous Parking Lot: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/6003635/WayFair-Automated-Parking-Lot-Problem-Design/
  \t* I had to draw the class diagrams and the schema design.
  \t* Got grilled during class diagrams and little time for was left for API design.
* HM & HR Rounds - In person
  \t* asked about projects, some classic behavioural questions related to conflicts, toughest projects etc

**Verdict**: Rejected
**Feedback**:
* I had hadn\'t given the rounds in Java which was a big no-no. Though, I had asked one of the interviewers whether I had to use Java and they said it isn\'t a requirement.
* I was also told my combined LLD + HM round was not positive.

It is unfortunate that language played a part in the decision. Imo, no point asking leetcode questions if you want a particular language to be used.

Got rejected by Wayfair recently. Wanted to share my experience.

Process:
* OA - 2 DSA questions
  \t* A BFS question with a n * m and upto k steps that can be taken per move in a given direction.
  \t * Don\'t remember the second question, but it was straightforward.
* Interview - Coding round
  \t* Categories and their Coupons. Categories are like a tree (i.e they have parents).
  \t* For a category, find it\'s "nearest" coupon + one extension question it.
* Interview - Low Level Design
  \t* The infamous Parking Lot: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/6003635/WayFair-Automated-Parking-Lot-Problem-Design/
  \t* I had to draw the class diagrams, DB schema, and API. Was grilled during class diagrams. Didn\'t get much time for the API part.
* HM and HR (separate rounds) - On Site
  \t*  Classic behavioral questions

**Verdict**: Rejected
**Feedback**:
* I had given the rounds in coding rounds in a language other than Java. I wasn\'t aware this would be such a dealbreaker even though I had communicated during the HR and HM rounds that I had experience in Java.
* My design and HM round were not up to the mark. Though I\'m not sure why I had to go onsite if my design round wasn\'t that great.

I applied on Instahyre and recruiter reached out to me and scheduled screening round via Hacker Rank.

HackerRank OA:
Q1: list the anagrams in given list of input strings for each string in the querylist.
ex: input = ["abc", "cba", "def"]
query = ["bca", "fde"]
output = [["abc","cba"],["def"]]
Q2: move through maze problem where each move from a source (0,0) can happen in all four directions (i+x,j)(i-x,j)(i, j-x)(i,j+x)) where x is a jum parameter if there are no obstacles in the way. we have to find minMoves required to reach destination.

Round 1: machine Coding round
This is little different we are given a description with all the methods to be implemented and formula(s) and conditions. The basic skeletal structure is given and we have to fill the methods.
Question: given a Package and Cargo classes implementing Ipackage and Ishipping methods respectively. the following methods needs to impelmented in the Cargo class.
-> addPackage(Ipackage pack)
-> removePackage(int: id)
-> int calculatetotalShippingCost()
->Map<String,Integer> packageList()
->Map<String, List<Integer>> categoryList()

total cost can be found using the following formula.
for each package in package list => lwh = length * weight* height
cost for that package =>
lwh<=100000 : cost =10
100000<lwh<=50000: cost = 20
lwh>50000: cost = 30
Total cost = sum of calculated cost of all packages in the package list.

category can be determined based on the weight of the product. couldn\'t remember exact numbers but it is something like this
weight < 5 => small
5<=weight <=10 => medium
weight >10 => large

packagelist() -> should return a map with packagename,quantity
categorylist() -> should return a map with categoryname,List(packageids)

Waiting for the feedback. I got confused with the question and couldn\'t finish the code on time. Not expecting to clear this round as I couldn\'t finish coding. Time management is the key.

Hope this helps if anyone is preparing for the interview

I recently interviewed at Wayfair for a SDE 2 opening.

There were 4 rounds in total.

1. Online coding assessment on hackerrank. This had 2 coding questions (easy) and 1 sql query (medium-hard).
   I could only do 2 coding questions.
   Got a call for next round.

2. This was a machine coding round. The interviewer presents a coding question on hackerrank again with 13 testcases. It was shipment and package management. You can easily find it in some other discussions. I would say do not over engineer your solution. workd with basic solution unless the interviewer wants something more.

3. This was LLD round. Very common wayfair Bike rental question. I was expected to come up with class diagram, schema diagram and API design. The interviwer questioned a lot of decisions I made and I wasn\'t able to defend them nicely. Also he didn\'t seem very happy with my api design as I was using query params a lot maybe.

Got a call from HR after 2 days that feedback from machine coding round was very good but LLD was not satisfactory. You can apply again after 4 months.

One thing I\'d like to mention is unlike a lot of other posts who had bad experience working with wayfair HR/recruiters,
I had a very pleasant experience. He was very supportive and was nice enough to say that we can keep in touch if you would like to apply again after 4 months.

Hi all,

I have interviews scheduled in January for SDE2 role at Wayfair, Boston, MA.

I wanted to ask for any resources to prepare for these rounds, like for DSA, I am able to get Wayfair tagged questions, but I\'m also  looking for questions that are not in eetcode but were asked in Wayfair.

And also a few examples and resources for Application Architecture/LLD round, I found that they frequently ask Parking Lot, Bike reservation, Hotel reservation questions. But I wanted to know if there were any other questions they might be asking. Also, what are the expectations of this round? I\'m thinking providing Object Models, Classes (Skeleton and if time permits implementations), API endpoints, Database Schemas and Some tradeoffs would be enough for this round. But are there any other concepts that I should keep in mind?

I would appreciate any kind of help. Especially from someone who interviewed for them recently.!

Thanks.!

- **As per I remember there where 3 questions of DSA in online coding round for rating the level of questions I would say medium , medium and medium:** hard level for three questions. I had done all three questions.
- **2nd round:** (Technical case study round ) : After 2 days , I got mail as I was shorlisted from coding and my technical interview was scheduled. Technical interview was different than of other he used gave me a part of question like (was held in hackerearth) :
- **Round 3:** (Managerial and Hr round): Next day I got the mail that i was shorlisted from technical case study round and will soon schedule hiring manager and hr round.
- **LC  stats:** 1865( Knight) , 700 + questions

Additional info:
- I had applied using referral for off campus opportunity at Wayfair for winter intern role as Software Engineer Intern.
- Suppose you and your friends have to shift your room items to another place and you have 2 vehicle one is small and big and items are also categorised as small and big items then  asked me what are the parameter that you would need to shift all the items with minimum number of turns.
- After discussing all the necessary information he gave the code of the same question and told me to understand the code and explain. There was some mathematical equation also which was defining the relation on vehicle and items , we did discussion on it and later on he asked me to modify the code as the code wasn\'t returing the desired output and I did that too.
- He scheduled my interview for 3rd december and i had major project evaluation that day. I told him to reschedule my interview and he rescheduled my interview for 5th december and on the morning he mentioned that "Panel is sick and  i will schdule your interview soon".. But from that day he never replied my mail and no any response .
- Bad Luck I guess

Recrutier reached out to me via phone call and then rounds were scheduled.

**Round 1** : Machine coding round
**Experience** : Hackkerrank problem based on OOPS concept, needed to write a lot of code and everything was expected to be working and passing all test cases.
***Design order management system***
needed to design cart functionalities, calculating total cart value, etc,
working code was expected, needed to pass all 13/13 test cases to proceed further,
interviewer was chilled out but still you always need to think out loud.

**Round 2** : Low Level Design (APIs | DB Schema | DTOs | Follow ups) were expected
**Experience** :
***Parking Lot Design***
interviewer was not at all open for extensibility of the design, he just focussed on
getting the requirements done (too strictly, ideally interviewer should be open
for that)
anyways managed to satisfy his expectations:
class structures attributes and methods
API specs with request/response models
DB schema with follow up questions based on foreign keys, sharding keys, indexing
then he wanted me to tell the flow of APIs verbally

Got selected in this round, HR moved to HM round

**Round 3** : Hiring Manager round
**Experience** : 30 mins discussion with a senior manager asked about my current project and some discussion around it.
then closed the interview with some basic behvaioural questions

Then later had a HR round post that offer was discussed, HR was too strict about the joining date.

There were **3 questions in the interview, basic, intermediate and advanced**
**1) Basic**
This one was to find pairs with target difference in an array.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 2
output = 3
I solved it by making a dictionary of counts of numbers and then added the target to each element of array to check if it exists in the dictionary and returned the result of the summation of counts of exisiting arrays

**2) Intermediate**
It was a subsequence question in which we had to find minimum sum subsequence such that
sub[0] < sub[1] > sub[2] in all len = 3 subsequences

I could not find the optimal solution for this, I tried creating an array of all subsequences of length 3 and traverese through them to find the one with the minimum sum but kept reaching recursion depth passed like half the test cases

**3) Advanced**
We are given 3 integers n, m and totalCost

totalCost is the number of swaps that happen during linear search of maximum number in array\\
```
x = arr[0]
totalCost = 0
for i in range(len(arr)):
\tif  arr[i] > x:
\t\tx = arr[i]
\t\ttotalCost += 1
```
we had to find number of arrays of totalCost equal to the given totalCost such that
each array is of length n
and arr[i] <= m where i is from 0 to n
arr[i] \u2208 \u2115

I tried creating all possibilites and then storing in an array to calculate total cost and return answer but I couldnt even pass a single test case as I didnt leave myself enought time for the last test case.

I dont think I will be selected this time but if someone could help me solve these so that I wont mess up like this again it would be really nice.

Hi all, I had recently been interviewed at Wayfair for L3 position.
Total YOE : 8 years

1. **Hacker Rank OA** : This round consists of two LC medium difficulty level questions based on arrays and strings. Don\'t remembered the question as such.
2. **Machine Coding Round**: The interviewer asked me to provide the implementation details of an order management system.
3. **Low-Level Design**: Here, I was asked to design standard car rental problem.
4. **High-Level Design**: The interviewer asked to design a music recognition service like Shazam.
5. **Behavioural Round**: This round consist of questions such as, current project details and my role in current project, and standard questions like : how do you handle conflicts in the team? How do you gather requirements ? How you handle production bugs which were critical etc.

I am done with all the rounds three days before the diwali festival. Today, when I asked the recruiter about the feeback, I got to know that the interviewer has given slightly negative feedback on HLD round. I asked about the feedback details, he said he\'ll get back to me with the details as well and also he\'ll discuss with the hiring manager about the work around that he can do now. Since my other coding rounds went pretty well, and also in the HLD round I had priorly did that question of \'Shazam app\' from youtube video and that only I had explained in the round. I even asked the interviewer in that round is he in-align with my design or am I doing any thing out of order which he is not clear about. I was explaining my thought process loud through out the round.

I wanted to know, that,
1.  Is there any chance of getting the offer letter ? or,
2.  The HM can conduct one more HLD discussion?

what plan of action generally they (wayfair) follow in this case?

Has anyone of you have gone through such experience in your interview process? Kindly share your experience/thought.

Design Parking Lot (with API and DB schema design, SQL query was asked to count no of vehicles of currently parked in this parking lot) you have to design a simple parking lot where no concept of floors. It is machine operated like below image. User gives his car at parking entrance and handed over with a ticket and machine parks his car.

Applied for Software Engineer III position at WayFair on **13th September**.
Round 1:
HackerRank OA: Passed (**20th September**)

Call with HR: Asked me to give the coding round in Java only (The careers page says otherwise).

Round 2:
Online Interview Scheduled: (**26th September**): No show from interviewer

After multiple calls and emails, they finally scheduled it for **15th October** where again the different interviewer didn\'t show up.

I\'m not sure when are they going to come back to me but preparing for OA and then first round of interview is always difficult including the pre-interview stress and anxiety. Specially considering I\'m find a job after a lay off in July.

I\'m in offer negotitations with another companies but this is so poor management and no body to be accounted for.

### 48. [Wayfair | Software Engineer (L3) | Bangalore | Rejected](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/5784931/wayfair-software-engineer-l3-bangalore-r-gc2r)


# Wayfair | Software Engineer (L3) | Bangalore | Rejected

- **Author:** None
- **Created at:** Sep 14, 2024 at 08:54 AM
- **Updated at:** Sep 14, 2024 at 08:54 AM
- **Tags:** Wayfair, Interview

**Total Work Experience**: 4.5 years
**Career Break**: 1.5 years
**Previous Company**: Google
**Education**: IIT

Recently, I went through the interview process for a Software Engineer (L3) position at Wayfair. The process included four rounds; I was rejected after the fourth, so I didn\'t proceed to the fifth.
**Interview Date**: August 2024

**Online Assessment (OA) Round**
The OA consisted of 2 coding questions in 60 minutes (1 easy, 1 hard).
[Link to the OA question](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/5382948/Wayfair-or-SWE-or-OA)
The first question was challenging. I used BFS but could only get 12/15 test cases correct.

**Coding Round**
[Link to the question: Coupan category](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/4491846/Wayfair-or-SDE2-L2-4-Onsite-Virtual-or-Coupon-category)
I had seen this problem before, which helped me complete it successfully with all follow-ups. Without prior exposure, I don\'t think I would have been able to finish it on time.

**Low-Level Design (LLD) Round**
The problem was [bike rental shop question](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/4503513/Wayfair-or-L2-L4-or-Virual-Onsite-or-LLD-or-Bike-Rental-Shop), and I was well-prepared. However, the interview was a bit chaotic. The interviewer was new (conducting their first interview), and a more senior member was shadowing. Unfortunately, the senior member interrupted frequently, creating confusion as they seemed to have different expectations. It felt like I was interviewing with two people who weren\'t on the same page, which affected my performance.
Make sure to cover key areas like API design, class structure, and database schema.

**High-Level Design (HLD) Round**
The problem was a [mobile check-in system](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/5784840/Wayfair-or-L3-or-HLD-or-August-2024). I struggled with time management and was only able to cover the basic components and requirements.
In an HLD interview, try to touch on as many topics as possible: rate limiting, caching, asynchronous processing, normalization, consistent hashing, LRU cache, analytics, etc.

**Verdict**: Rejected
**Feedback**: While I performed well in the coding round, my performance in LLD and HLD was not up to the expectations. Had I done better in any one of these design rounds, I could have cleared the interview.

Stay curious, keep coding, and enjoy the journey!
