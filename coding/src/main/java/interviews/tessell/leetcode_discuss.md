Round 1: DSA  (Duration: 60 mins)
This was a DSA round focused mainly on Dynamic Programming and Bit Manipulation. There were 2 coding problems:

Problem 1 (DP):
Given an array of integers, find the number of ways to partition it into two subsets such that the difference between their sums is a given value diff.
Concepts used: Subset sum DP, memoization.

Problem 2 (Bit Manipulation):
Given an integer array, find the unique number that appears once while all others appear three times.
Concepts used: Bitwise operations, bit counting.

Both problems were medium to hard level. I was able to solve the DP problem completely and partially solve the bit manipulation one.

Round 2: System Design – Design Netflix-like Streaming Platform
This was a 60-minute video call with a senior engineer. The task was to design a high-level architecture for a video streaming platform (like Netflix).

Topics discussed:

How users stream video efficiently at scale

Handling content delivery across regions (CDN, edge caching)

Database design for users, shows, history

Upload and transcoding pipeline for new content

Scaling: microservices, load balancing, and fault tolerance

Handling spikes in traffic and user recommendations

I covered most areas decently. The interviewer was collaborative and guided me in areas where I lacked depth.

Round 3: Managerial + Technical Round
This round focused on past projects, ownership, and dealing with real-world tech challenges. Some behavioral + technical questions included:

Explain a difficult bug you resolved under pressure.

Describe a system you designed end-to-end.

How do you prioritize tasks when deadlines conflict?

What trade-offs did you face in your previous system architecture?

How do you handle disagreements in a tech team?

Although I answered sincerely and explained my reasoning, I think I struggled to justify some architectural decisions and didn’t showcase leadership/ownership strongly. The interviewer seemed unconvinced about my decision-making clarity.

Round 4: Final Status
Unfortunately, I got a rejection after Round 3. Feedback mentioned I did well in DSA and System Design, but they were looking for someone with stronger decision-making and communication in cross-functional scenarios.

We spent 30 mins discussing the "most technical" work that I have done along with some questions around my resume. I was asked 1 question where he was looking for the optimal approach. He mentioned that we can implement it, if we have time in the end.

Question:

```
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n, count the pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and nums1[i] + nums1[j] > nums2[i] + nums2[j].

Return the number of pairs satisfying the condition.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,1,2,1], nums2 = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The pairs satisfying the condition are:
- (0, 2) where 2 + 2 > 1 + 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,10,6,2], nums2 = [1,4,1,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The pairs satisfying the condition are:
- (0, 1) where 1 + 10 > 1 + 4.
- (0, 2) where 1 + 6 > 1 + 1.
- (1, 2) where 10 + 6 > 4 + 1.
- (1, 3) where 10 + 2 > 4 + 5.
- (2, 3) where 6 + 2 > 1 + 5.
```

The interviewer was kind enough to provide hints ([lc-question](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-in-two-arrays)), but I was unable to come up with the right approach

### 3. [🎯 Frontend Interview Experience with Tessell](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6720737/frontend-interview-journey-with-tessell-rzsy8)


# 🎯 Frontend Interview Experience with Tessell

Hi everyone,
I'm a frontend developer with over 1+ year of experience working with React, Next.js, and JavaScript. I recently had the opportunity to interview with Tessell, a startup I’ve always admired, and wanted to share my interview journey here on LeetCode Discuss to help or inspire others preparing for frontend roles.


🧩 Interview Rounds at Tessell
1. Initial HR Screening
   The process kicked off with an HR call where we discussed basic details like current/expected CTC, notice period, and availability. It set the tone for what turned out to be a long yet well-structured process.

2. Technical Round – JavaScript & React Focus
   This round went deep into JavaScript fundamentals and React concepts. Topics included:

Lifecycle methods

State management approaches (Redux, Context API)

Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading, etc.)

Best practices in component architecture

3. DSA Round – Medium-Level Challenges
   The second round tested my algorithmic skills through JavaScript coding. Problems were medium level and tested my approach to clean and efficient code. This is where consistent LeetCode practice helped a lot.

4. Engineering Manager Round – Tech + Behavioral
   This was a mix of system-level questions and behavioral discussion. I had to walk through:

Key decisions in past projects

Real-world optimizations and architecture choices

A hard-level DSA question on trees,
📌 One of the similar types of problems discussed was Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/ – definitely worth practicing!

5. Final HR Discussion
   After clearing all rounds, the HR shared a verbal offer. However, shortly after, I received another offer that aligned better with my long-term goals and recognized my value based on skill, not just current CTC.

✨ Reflections & Learnings
Although I ultimately didn’t accept Tessell’s offer, I left the process with immense respect for their team and interview structure. It helped me grow technically and reaffirmed some key career truths:

🧠 Key Takeaways
Know your worth: Your skills are more important than your current salary.

Stay interview-ready: Balance your DSA prep with real-world frontend knowledge.

Explore options: More offers = better clarity and confidence.

Communicate professionally: Whether it’s a yes or no, always respond with maturity.

Think long-term: Choose opportunities aligned with your values and growth path.

🙌 Final Thoughts
This experience was a reminder that interviews are not just about getting an offer — they’re opportunities to reflect, improve, and clarify your goals. I'm grateful to Tessell for the chance, and who knows — our paths might cross again in the future.

Good luck to everyone preparing — keep learning, keep coding!

### 4. [SSE Data Platform || Tessell || Selected](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/5912630/sse-data-platform-tessell-selected-by-an-enr0)

- **Tags:** High Level Design, Interview

Got the referral through 3rd party recruitment firm

**Round 1** -
Question was tough, but interviewer was helpful, gave a lot of hints

Given a sample equation -> ? + ? + ? - ? = 6
All the question marks can be replaced by any natural number starting from 1 to (k-1) , k is RHS value
So every question mark will be strictly less than RHS value

The one above is a sample equation the count of question marks can range from 1 to 100
and between two question marks there can be a (+) sign or a (-) sign

The value in RHS can range from 1 to 10,000

Find a way to compute the values of question marks so that you can return at least 1 set of numbers that satisfies the equation.

If no such set is possible, return empty set.

**Round 2** -
Code to convert Sorted linkedList to balanced BST + Project discussion

Did pseudocode properly, could not run the code as got stuck in between and then
when completed the time was offer

**Round 3** -
Twitter system design.
Interviewer was interactive. Covered almost all requirements decently

**Round 4** -
HM round, mostly technical round centred around projects and some aws implementation questions and bit of behavorial.
Went decent

**Round 5** -
Discussion with Director of engineering, mostly around work and company.
Round looked like a formality

Overall experience of interview was great, interviewers were helpful and knowledgable.

They took few weeks to roll out the offer after the selection email which looked like a long time considering it is a Series A startup.
The offer was good but I went to ahead with another offer for personal reasons.

I found their work interesting and strong team, but due to some personal career goals went ahead with another company.
