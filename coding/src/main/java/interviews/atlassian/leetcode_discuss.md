Hey LeetCode fam 💙

I’ve made the painful decision to step away from tech… but before I go, I’m asking for one last chance — a referral to any Frontend (React.js), Backend, or Internship role.

I’ve spent nights grinding LC, building full-stack apps, debugging APIs, styling components till they sang — and still, I’m being ghosted. **No referrals. No responses.** Just silence.

# If you’re at a company hiring for:
✅ Frontend (React.js)
✅ Backend (Node.js,Java, etc.)
✅ Internships (yes, I’ll start from scratch)

… and you’re willing to refer me — you’ll be changing my life.

**No need to DM — just comment “I got you” or tag me in a referral post. I’ll reach out immediately.**

This community taught me to code. Maybe it can help me land before I walk away.

Thank you for seeing me when no one else did.

Hi everyone,

I recently received offers from a few companies and would appreciate your views on choosing between Emergent Labs, Super Money, and Atlassian.

Current Situation:
Company: JioHotstar
YOE: 6
Pay: ₹40L (₹36L fixed + ₹4L variable)

The Offers:
1. Emergent Labs
   Profile: An AI builder, similar to Bolt, Lovable, and Replit. They have recently gained significant traction and are well-funded. The team consists of 15-20 engineers, including the founders, working from Bangalore and SF. This role offers great exposure to the AI world and numerous learning opportunities.
   Cons: Might require a 6-day workweek, including some Sundays. There is also a potential risk to job security.

Role: SDE 3
Fixed Pay: ₹53L
Esops: Worth ₹5L
Bonus: ₹2.5L

2. Super.Money
   Profile: A subsidiary of Flipkart, nearly a unicorn, and growing rapidly. The role is 5 days/week in the office. The pay is similar to Emergent's, with their own esops (not Flipkart's). I would be working on foundational front-end development for both web and mobile, which presents strong learning opportunities.

Role: SDE 3
Fixed Pay: ₹55L
Esops: 130 units
Relocation: Benefits provided
Bonus: ₹2L

3. Atlassian
   Profile: I am strongly considering Atlassian primarily for the brand value and the overall compensation, which is better due to liquid stocks. The fixed pay is almost the same as the other two.
   Cons is role(SDE2) and the recent reviews about the company.

Role: SDE 2
Fixed Pay: ₹53L
Bonus: ₹8L
Stocks: $15k USD/year
Joining Bonus: ₹5L

I've provided this context for a fair comparison. Please let me know your views. If you have any insights from working at these companies or other factors I should consider, I would be very grateful.

How does it happens , My team matching is with HM of Backend and I dont have any experience with backend , My tech stack is cpp + Java in embedded
domain .

I have to join GS 1st or 2nd week of september .It offered 32+5 for me .

If i dont able to convince this HM , I might not get any team match near by before joining GS .

As of now I am feeling atlassian is better pick than Goldman Sachs . In terms of career growth although pip is a big concern .A brand might enter into CV .

Can Some one tell whats the process of HM round , whats expected and how to convince HM in 30 min.

How bad is pip , How often is getting fired with in first year after joining atlassian ?Is there any one who recently got hired and with whom I can connect .

Can someone please share the optimal solutions for the Atlassian DS question bank?
Find the closest Org for target Employees
a) Imagine you are the team that maintains the Atlassian employee directory. At Atlassian – there are multiple groups, and each can have one or more groups. Every employee is part of a group. You are tasked with designing a system that could find the closest common parent group giv a target set of employees in the organization.
b) The Atlassian hierarchy sometimes can have shared group across an org or employees shared across different groups – How will the code evolve n this case if the requirement is to provide ONE closest common group
c) The system now introduced 4 methods to update the structure of the hierarchy in the org. Supose these dynamic updates are done in separate threads while getCommonGroupForEmployees is being called, How ill your system handled reads and writes into the system efficiently such that at any given time getCommonGroupForEmployees always reflects the latest updated state of the hierarchy?
d) The company consists of a single level of groups with no subgroups. Each group has a set of employees.

Expanding Tennis Club
a) Implement a function that given a list of tennis court cookings with start and finish times, returns a plan assigning each booking to a specific court, ensuring each court is used by only one booking at a time and using the minimum amount of courts with unlimites number of courts available.
An example of the booking record might look like

Class BookingRecord:
Id: int//ID of the booking
Start_time: int
Finish_time: int

And our function is going to look like:

List assignCourts(List bookingRecords)

b) After each booking, a fixed amount of time, X, is needed to maintain the court before it can be rented again
c) Court only need maintainenece after X amount of usage
How would you modify the code if each court also had a Y maintainence time that occurred after X bookings?
The function should now become something like
Def assign_court_with_maintainence(booking_records: list{BookingRecord],

Maintainence_time: int,

Durability: int) -> list[Court]:
d) The original problem can be made simpler by removing the “assigning each booking to a specific court” part. The candidate needs to find the minimum number of courts needed to accommodate all the bookings
e) Check if booking conflict - Write a function that if given two bookings to check if they conflict with each other

Commodity Prices
Imagine you are given a stream of data points consisting of <timestamp, commodityPrice> you are supposed to return the maxCommodityPrice at any point in time.
The timestamps in the stream can be out of order, or there can be duplicate timestamps, we need to update the commodityPrice at that particular timestamp if an entry for the timestamp already exists
Create an in-memory solution tailored to prioritize frequent reads and writes for the given problem statement
Can we reduce the time complexity of the getMaxCommodityPrice to O(1) if the language does not support it? This can be done using a variable to keep the maxPrice value, but we need to update it when performing the upsert operations.

Popular content
Imagine you are given a stream of content ids along with an associated action to be performed on them
Example of contents are video, pages, posts etc. There cam be two actions associated with a content id:
• increasePopularity -> increases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity increases when someone comments on the content or likes the comtent
• decreasePopularity-> decreases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity decreases when a spam bot’s/users comments are deleted from the content or its likes are removed from the content
• content ids are positive integers
Implement a class that can return the mostPopular content id at any time while consuming the stream of content ids and its associated action. If there are no contentIds with popularity greater than 0, return -1

### **Interview Experience**

I applied to multiple SDE2 openings on **the** portal. I got **a** call from a recruiter. I'll consider the recruiter contact day as Day 0.

#### Day 1 : Karat Interview (1 hr)

##### System design Questions

1.) We are working on a clone of Facebook. We want to add a numeric count to every post showing how many friends the post's author has at the time of viewing the post. The database schema looks like this:
**USER**
* `user_id` (primary key)
* `name`
* `created_date`

**USER RELATIONSHIP**
* `friendship_id` (primary key, unique to each relationship)
* `user_id` (indexed)
* `user2_id` (indexed)
* `start_date`

Focusing on the database, how would you implement the friend-count feature? Note that we will soon be more popular than Facebook, so the solution needs to scale.

2.) We are working on a clone of Google Docs. The software has the following features and limitations:
* Multiple users may work on a single document at the same time.
* A document must be handled by a single server, no matter how many users **there are**.
* We have a fixed number of servers which will be sufficient to handle our **expected load** properly.

Our load balancer uses a round-robin system to permanently assign documents to each server, so **that** each will have an equal number of documents. Do you have any concerns about this load **balancing** system? In those cases, how would you fix the **scalability issue**?

3.) Which consistency model is more appropriate for each of these applications: **strong** or **eventual** consistency? Why?
* An API call that needs to respond within 20 milliseconds, used to retrieve **video stream metadata**. The metadata includes things like the author name, rating, and **view count**.
* A web analytics platform recording every single click on a popular web page.
* A banking system that makes deposits and payments to checking accounts.

4.) **Another scenario was that** there was a bug on an application, and you ended up having a lot of failed requests. You have a database that stores all IDs, and you also have large log files from about 500 different production servers that log the IDs of the successful requests. How would you come up with a solution to find the IDs that were missing?

##### Coding Question
The question was similar to [68. Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/description/) and had one **follow-up**. I was able to fully solve the question and **gave my** approach for the **follow-up**.

---

#### Day 6 : Data Structures Interview (1 hr)

You have `N` services **in** a network. You are given which servers are connected and the connection latency. For example `[1, 2, 200]` means service `1` calls service `2` and it has a latency of 200ms. You are given `Q` queries where you have to output the minimum latency from Service `X` to Service `Y`.

**The** interviewer wanted to discuss why classic DFS and BFS should not be the solution, how **Dijkstra's** algorithm **would** work, **what the** other ways **are** to solve this, and **the** time complexity.

In the end, I provided the solution using **Dijkstra's** algorithm.

**Rating:** Hire (Medium confidence)

---

#### Day 7 : Code Design Interview (1 hr)

**Customer Satisfaction**

a) Imagine we have a customer support ticketing system. The system allows customers to rate the support agent out of 5. To start with, write a function which accepts a rating, and another which will show me all of the agents and the average rating **each** one has received, ordered from highest to lowest.
c) Now I want to be able to see who the best agents are each month. Change the implementation so I can get that information.

I **followed the** `Test-Driven Development (TDD)` approach as mentioned by the recruiter in the preparation guide. Atlassian recruiters are really helpful.

**Rating:** Hire (Medium confidence)

---

#### Day 13 : System Design Interview (1 hr)

**Question: Tagging Management Service**

Atlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. As an example, let’s look at three of our products:

* Jira – Issues
* Confluence – Pages
* Bitbucket – Pull requests

We want to build a system that allows users to tag content from different products, and then to view content by tags. A goal of this system is that it should be built **in** a product-agnostic way so that we could add new products in the future without a large amount of work. There are three key experiences that we want to build here:

* As a user, I can add, remove, and update tags on content.
* As a user, I can click on a tag and see all content that has been associated with that tag.
* As a user, I can see a dashboard of popular tags.

**The** recruiter focused on API Specification, DB Schema, DB Choice (SQL/NoSQL), Communication protocols, SQS vs **RabbitMQ** vs Kafka, **and** Rate **limiting**.

**Rating:** Hire (Low confidence)

The recruiter mentioned the reason for the "low confidence hire" was that the **interviewer** felt the design was a little rushed.

---

#### Day 16 : Managerial Interview (1 hr)

**This involved** standard managerial-type **questions** based on my previous work experiences.

**Rating:** Hire (High confidence)

---

#### Day 20 : Values Interview (45 mins)

**The questions were similar to those mentioned** in the following LeetCode article:
[[Disclosed] Atlassian Full Loop Question [SSE & SDE 2]](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6974858/disclosed-atlassian-full-loop-question-b-ulje/)

**Rating:** Hire (High confidence)

---

##### Day 31 : **Got** confirmation about the HC Result
##### Day 35 : **The** recruiter scheduled a team matching meeting
##### Day 38 : **I had the** team matching call
##### Day 41 : **I received the offer**


Here’s your content reformatted for clarity and structure without removing any part of the original content. I've grouped related parts into sections, preserved all sub-points, and organized them cleanly for easier understanding.

---

## **Round 1 & 2 – Data Structures Question Bank**

---

### **1. Find the Closest Org for Target Employees**

**a)**
Imagine you are the team that maintains the Atlassian employee directory. At Atlassian, there are multiple groups, and each can have one or more groups. Every employee is part of a group.
You are tasked with designing a system that could **find the closest common parent group** given a target set of employees in the organization.

**b)**
The Atlassian hierarchy sometimes can have **shared groups across an org** or **employees shared across different groups**.
How will the code evolve in this case if the requirement is to provide **ONE closest common group**?

**c)**
The system now introduced **4 methods to update the structure** of the hierarchy in the org.
Suppose these dynamic updates are done in separate threads **while `getCommonGroupForEmployees` is being called**,
How will your system handle **reads and writes** efficiently such that at any given time `getCommonGroupForEmployees` always reflects the **latest updated state** of the hierarchy?

**d)**
The company consists of a **single level of groups with no subgroups**. Each group has a set of employees.

---

### **2. Expanding Tennis Club**

**a)**
Implement a function that, given a list of tennis court bookings with start and finish times,
returns a plan assigning each booking to a specific court, ensuring:

* Each court is used by only one booking at a time
* Using the **minimum number of courts** (unlimited courts available)

**Booking Record Class Example:**

```python
class BookingRecord:
    id: int        # ID of the booking
    start_time: int
    finish_time: int
```

**Function Signature:**

```python
List assignCourts(List bookingRecords)
```

**b)**
After each booking, a **fixed amount of time, X**, is needed to **maintain** the court before it can be rented again.

**c)**
Courts only need maintenance **after X amount of usage**.
How would you modify the code if each court also had a **Y maintenance time** that occurred after **X bookings**?

**New Function Signature:**

```python
def assign_court_with_maintainence(
    booking_records: list[BookingRecord],
    maintainence_time: int,
    durability: int
) -> list[Court]:
```

**d)**
The original problem can be made simpler by **removing the “assigning each booking to a specific court”** part.
The candidate needs to **find the minimum number of courts** needed to accommodate all the bookings.

**e)**
**Check if booking conflict** – Write a function that, given two bookings, checks if they **conflict with each other**.

---

### **3. Commodity Prices**

Imagine you are given a **stream of data points** consisting of `<timestamp, commodityPrice>`.

* You are supposed to return the **maxCommodityPrice** at any point in time.
* The timestamps in the stream can be **out of order**, or there can be **duplicate timestamps**.
* We need to **update the commodityPrice** at that particular timestamp if an entry for the timestamp already exists.

**Requirements:**

* Create an **in-memory solution** tailored to prioritize **frequent reads and writes**.
* **Can we reduce time complexity of `getMaxCommodityPrice` to O(1)** if the language doesn’t support it?

    * This can be done using a **variable to keep the maxPrice** value, but we need to **update it during upsert operations**.

---

### **4. Popular Content**

Imagine you are given a stream of **content IDs** along with an associated **action**.

**Examples of content:** videos, pages, posts, etc.

**Actions:**

* `increasePopularity` → increases the popularity of the content by 1
  (when someone **likes/comments** on the content)
* `decreasePopularity` → decreases the popularity of the content by 1
  (when **spam comments/likes are removed**)

**Constraints:**

* Content IDs are **positive integers**

**Task:**

Implement a class that can **return the most popular content ID at any time** while consuming the stream.
If there are no content IDs with popularity greater than 0, **return -1**.

---

## **Code Design Question Bank**

---

### **1. Customer Satisfaction**

**a)**
Imagine a customer support ticketing system.
The system allows customers to **rate the support agent (out of 5)**.

* Write a function that **accepts a rating**
* Another function to show all agents and their **average rating**, **ordered highest to lowest**

**b)**
Currently, the solution does not handle **ties** (same average rating).
What are the options for handling ties and how can we implement that in code?

**c)**
Now you want to be able to see who the **best agents are each month**.
Change the implementation to support **monthly insights**.

**d)**
Write a new function to **export each agent’s average ratings per month**.
You can export in any format – e.g., **CSV, JSON, or XML**.

**e)**

* Make it return **average ratings unsorted**
* Make it return the **total rating** for each agent without the average

---

### **2. Middleware Router**

We want to implement a **middleware router** for a web service,
which returns different strings based on the **path**.

**Router Interface:**

```kotlin
interface Router {
    fun addRoute(path: String, result: String): Unit
    fun callRoute(path: String): String
}
```

**Usage Example:**

```kotlin
Router.addRoute("/bar", "result")
Router.callRoute("/bar") // → "result"
```

**Scale Ups:**

* **Scale Up 1:** Wildcards using **ordered checking**
* **Scale Up 2:** PathParams
  (*Optional or can be removed entirely*)

---

### **3. Game of Snakes**

Classic snake game logic in a 2D board.

**Rules:**

* The snake can move **up, down, left, or right**
* Initial size is **3**
* Grows by 1 every **5 moves**
* Game ends when **snake hits itself**

**Interface Example:**

```python
interface SnakeGame {
    moveSnake(snakeDirection)
    isGameOver()
}
```

**Proposed Changes:**

* **Change #1:**
  Make **Scale-Up 2 (PathParams)** optional or remove completely

* **Change #2:**
  Add new optional **Scale-Up**:
  Snake **grows when it eats food** (not every 5 moves)
  Food is **dropped randomly** on the board.

---

### **4. Cost Explorer**

Imagine you're on the **Payments Team at Atlassian**.
A customer subscribes to Jira and wants to **explore their expected costs** for the rest of the year.

**Task:**

Develop a **CostExplorer** that calculates the total cost a customer has to pay in a **unit year**.

At **any day of the year**, the system should provide a **provisional report** giving:

1. **Monthly cost**

    * Generate a bill for each month
    * Include bill amount for **future months**
2. **Yearly cost estimated** (for the unit year)

**Level 0:**
Support **Multiple Plans** for a product.


Here's the **clean and fully formatted** version of your **System Design Question Bank** without any missing content:

---

# **System Design Question Bank**

---

### **Question 1 – Tagging System**

**Context:**
Atlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. For example:

* **Jira** – Issues
* **Confluence** – Pages
* **Bitbucket** – Pull requests

We want to build a system that allows users to **tag content from different products** and then **view content by tags**. The goal is to build it in a **product-agnostic way**, allowing future product additions with minimal effort.

---

**Key User Experiences:**

1. As a user, I can **add, remove, and update tags** on content.
2. As a user, I can **click on a tag** and see all content that has been associated with that tag.
3. As a user, I can see a **dashboard of popular tags**.

---

**Steps:**

* Part 1: API Design
* Part 2: Data Modeling

### **Question 2 – Web Scraper**

**Design a service** which receives a list of URLs, scrapes those URLs for:

* **Links to other pages**
* **Image references** (i.e., the `src` attribute of `<img>` tags)

Returns a **mapping of page URLs to lists of image URLs**.
The service:

* Does **not need to download/store** the images
* Should **follow links recursively** (i.e., 2nd, 3rd... nth level pages)

---

**API Contract:**

* **POST `/jobs`**
  **Body:** JSON array of URLs to start scraping from
  *Example*:

  ```json
  ["https://google.com", "https://www.statuspage.io"]
  ```

  **Returns:** A **job identifier**

* **GET `/jobs/:job_id/status`**
  **Returns:**

  ```json
  {
    "completed": x,
    "in_progress": y
  }
  ```

  Where:

    * `x` = number of original URLs completely crawled
    * `y` = number of original URLs still being crawled

* **GET `/jobs/:job_id/results`**
  **Returns:**

  ```json
  {
    "https://google.com": [
      "https://google.com/images/logo_sm_2.gif",
      "https://google.com/images/warning.gif"

##### Compensation:
[Atlassian | P40 | India [Accepted]](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7069410/atlassian-p40-india-accepted-by-anonymou-p3qh/)

---

##### Remarks
Here are my thoughts on my recent 6-month job search:

* **The Market:** It's tough out there. Interviews are hard, and there is little room for mistakes.
* **My Journey:** It was a long road. I was rejected by many companies like Apple, Dream11, Microsoft (2 times), Arcesium, Myntra, Tekion, Google, Salesforce (Ghosted), and Uber (Ghosted) before I finally got offers from Microsoft and Atlassian.
* **What Helped:** My previous experience at a FAANG company made my resume stand out and helped me get more calls for interviews.
* **My Advice:** Just keep going. Don't let the rejections discourage you. Keep interviewing, and you will find the right job.

I recently got an offer from one of the FANGMULA companies, but they are not ready to consider my complete notice period, and my current company is not ready to reduce it because I am working on a few projects which will go live in a few months. Last week, I got a call from one of their senior managers stating that if I cannot reduce the notice period, I should look for another team. I was shocked and literally cried, but at around midnight, I received an email from the senior manager saying to go ahead with the candidate proposed (after serving my standard notice period) for the time being. However, I am not sure what will happen next, as one of the senior managers told me to look for another team, and in the email, they also mentioned “for the time being.”

They took one month to complete the background check and everything, and now they are not ready to proceed with the notice period.This company is also known for its PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) culture, which makes me even more uncertain about joining. The CTC they are offering is just a 2% increase in base and some stocks. Is it normal to have such behavior in FANGMULA companies?

I am expecting an offer from Atlassian for sde2 role. I am very sceptical in joining them. Recent blind reviews show they have a rigorous pip culture. Should I even consider them joining or pass on the offer. Currently in an Indian Startup but have been in Amazon and every 6 month the reviews take a mental toll. Left Amazon because of the same reason. Looking at present trends Indian startups look more of a safe place than these big companies. Pay jump is definately a plus point but do not want to experience another Amazon again.

Atlassian folks who are already there can you please help me decide?

Had Offer from Intuit -> Rejected the same because of forced PIP culture every 6 month

Currently holding offers for
GoldMan Sachs -> SDE2 (Have heard quality of work is not great)
Microsoft -> Security Team as SDE2 ->(Pay is less hence not considering it)

Currently expecting offer from Groww for SDE2.

Need some help.

I recently gave the DSA & Code Design round of Atlassian for SDE Position.


**Round 1 (DSA) :** I was able to solve the question completely (with optimal time complexity) but could only solve the 1st Follow-up partially.


**Round 2 (Code Design) :** I was able to code the question completely (with optimal time complexity) but while testing it - code failed on one test case. Could not find the bug in the code & later explained other various approaches (to the interviewer) also to solve that question.


I have one question -
1. What do you think - will my candidature proceed for further rounds?  I am yet to receive an update from recruiter. Because I really want to work in this organisation.


Please don't ask stupid questions like "How did i Apply?" "What is my Prev salary" etc. I am already really stressed because of result & want to crack Atlassian.


Please help.

Feedback: Couldn't fully solve the question and my behavioral stories lacked depth.

**Atlassian (P40)**

Karate Round: Hire

Coding Round: Hire

Code Design Round: Hire

System Design Round: Hire

Managerial & Values Round: No Hire

Feedback: Lacked strong alignment with Atlassian values.

**Arcesium (Lead SE)**

Online Assessment: Cleared

DSA Round: Solved one medium and one hard LeetCode problem within an hour.

Feedback: No Hire due to “slow coding” — which honestly feels surprising.
WTF! the interviewer is expecting from candidate in an hour.

And many similar experiences with startups as well.

Sometimes I wonder—is this just happening to me, or has the interview bar really gotten this high?

**Round 1:** Karat Screening Round
Don't remember the exact questions, but all are available or similar on LeetCode.

* 1 LC Medium
* 5 Multiple choice questions on system design

**Round 2: Code Design**
Agent Rating system: Return all of the agents and the average rating each one has received, ordered highest to lowest.

**Round 3: Data Structures**
Imagine you are the team that maintains the Atlassian employee directory.

At Atlassian, there are multiple groups, and each can have one or more groups. Every employee is part of a group.

You are tasked with designing a system that could find the closest common parent group, given a target set of employees in the organization.

**Round 4: System Design**
Design a system that allows users to pick a favorite color and share it with friends.

**Round 5: Managerial**
Questions around previous experience.

**Round 6: Values**
Questions around Atlassian values.

Do not take the Managerial and Values rounds lightly. These are pretty serious for P50+ roles and can downgrade or reject candidates based on these two rounds.

Overall, the experience took around 2 months and 1 day from verbal offer to the actual one.

Karat Round: 5 Sysytem design questions and 1 DSA question related to Djikstra Algo

Round 1: Interviewer asked to write a functionality about Customer care agents rating and display via sorted asc or desc order per overall ratings.
Focus: Try to test your code in JUnits.
Status: HIRE

Round 2: Company heriarchy related to LCA
Status: No HIRE / Lean HIRE

Recruiter called and informed I didn't perform well, We aren't moving forward.

After 2 weeks , He called and informed I understood the feedback in a wrong way. We are moving forward with you're interview process.

Round 3(System design): Twitter Hashtag , How it works
He focused more API design, Database optimization(grilled about Sharding and Indexing)
Focus: Try to focus more o API design and Database optimization.
Twist: called Recriter about feedback, He informed interviewer who interviewed me went on vacation for 2 weeks didn't update my feedback.
Also mentioned that we are end of quarter and hired enough people.
We are putting on hold, Someone from our team might reach out in future if they're any opening.M
*** After two weeks**
Recruiter reached out again and informed that we'll be conducting Management and values interview on same day.

Management Interview: Went well.

Here is the problem I didn't performed well in Values interview, Whenever she is asking I am talking about techical terms and project details.
She gave hints couple of times but ignored.

Focus: Don't take the Values interview too lightly it's also important, Please prepare for it. Don't perform like me as an idiot who almost saw a checkered flag but didn't crossed the final line.

Twist:Also called recruiter to check is they focus on values interview feedback immediately after the interview was done. He informed that you're 2nd round feedback is not good they might reject because of this.

In the first place why did they interviewd me for further rounds?


Feeling bad about myself almost daily why I gave shitty answers in values interview.

for the DSA part

# **DSA Question 1**


A list of strings representing the available parts in the factory bin.

A string representing the comma-separated list of required parts needed to fully build one robot.

```
Task: Implement a function that returns the list of robot names for which we can build at least one complete robot from the available parts.
```
Function Signature: **public static String[] get_robots(String[] all_parts, String required_parts)**

Sample Input:
String[] all_parts = { "Rosie_claw",
"Rosie_sensors",
"Dustie_case",
"Optimus_sensors",
"Rust_sensors",
"Rosie_case",
"Rust_case",
"Optimus_speaker",
"Rosie_wheels",
"Rosie_speaker",
"Dustie_case",
"Dustie_arms",
"Rust_claw",
"Dustie_case",
"Dustie_speaker",
"Optimus_case",
"Optimus_wheels",
"Rust_legs",
"Optimus_sensors" };


String required_parts_1 = "sensors,case,speaker,wheels";
String required_parts_2 = "sensors,case,speaker,wheels,claw";
String required_parts_3 = "sensors,case,screws";

**Expected Output:**
get_robots(all_parts, required_parts_1) => ["Optimus", "Rosie"]
get_robots(all_parts, required_parts_2) => ["Rosie"]
get_robots(all_parts, required_parts_3) => []

***My Solution that is accepted by the interviewer and passed all tests***.
1. create a map of robot to set of spare parts.
2. Check if all the required materials are in the set.. those robots that have all parts are the response.


# **DSA Question 2**
You work in an automated robot factory. Once robots are assembled, they are sent to the shipping center via a series of autonomous delivery carts, each of which moves packages on a one-way route.

```
Given input that provides the (directed) steps that each cart takes as pairs, write a function that identifies all the start locations, and a collection of all of the possible ending locations for each start location.
```

In this diagram, starting locations are at the top and destinations are at the bottom - i.e. the graph is directed exclusively downward.

A          E      J       Key:  [Origins]
/ \        / \      \                 \
B   C      F   L      M             [Destinations]
\ /  \   /
K     G
/ \
H   I

paths = [
["B", "K"],
["C", "K"],
["E", "L"],
["F", "G"],
["J", "M"],
["E", "F"],
["C", "G"],
["A", "B"],
["A", "C"],
["G", "H"],
["G", "I"]
]

**Expected output (unordered):**  
[
"A": ["K", "H", "I"],
"E": ["H", "L", "I"],
"J": ["M"]
]

N: Number of pairs in the input.

.........

***didn't finish this one..***

**solution whose idea was accepted by the interviewer and that i have started coding**

1. create a a graph and find the nodes that don't have inbound edge
2. from those nodes run dfs to find all the nodes that are leaves (no children)

I had my DSA round (after Karat) 2 days ago. I was asked one of the expected questions only, I wrote the code could not make it work due to some runtime issue. The logic was correct though and I did a dry run also. I have my code design already schedule in 2 days. Should I expect to still make it or I should focus on other companies?

0. ### Karat Round
    - Systems and debugging related questions - 5 questions. 3 of such are mentioned below. The theme was to ask clarifying questions and then suggesting and answer.
        - For company XYZ, there is an old model for a smart fridge which sends data to the cloud for computation. The company now plans to launch a new fridge where the processing power will be in the new fridge. What possible issues do you forsee? (Answered, low processing power and slow computations. Interviewer seemed content. Constant firmware upgrade and lack of hardware upgrade since it's on client's side are good answers too.)
        - A children's application converts children's vague drawing to animal animation and then the customers can choose the background for these animations from a fixed set of backgrounds. The animation is resource intensive. How do you plan to reduce the use of resources for this application? (Asked interviewer to clarify the nature of this animal animation converter, interviewer said, let's assume it identifies an animal and then animates. So suggested caching certain animations, once we identify an animal.)
        - The company receives data from multiple sources and calculate stats on these sources. One such source is returning bad data, how do we tackle the situation? (Asked which type of stat are we calculating, average might be fine but median might not be. Interviewer said, it's a redundant stat, so the conversation went towards not pushing too many requests to the broken source for it recover. Also, to vote out the stat itself.)
    - DSA Questions - 2 questions. I only recall one question. The second one was a follow-up to this one so it was similar in nature.
        - You are given 2 lists, one is called entry, which is timestamp sorted list of names who badged in while entering the conference room and the second one is called exit, which is timestamp sorted list of names who badged out while leaving the conference room. People often make mistakes, they either forget to badge in or badge out. You need to make a list of such people who have made this mistake/violation.

1. ### DSA round - 1 question
    - Question related to creating a data structure which represented incrementing karma on some platform, similar to increasing likes for a YT video. The question on leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-oone-data-structure/

2. ### DSA round - 1 question
    - We want to implement a middleware router for our web service, which based on the path returns different strings (these would represent “functions to invoke” in a real application).
      Usage:
      `Router.addRoute("/bar", "result")`
      `Router.callRoute("/bar") -> "result"`
      Implemented hashmap based solution wrapped in a class quickly. Then the follow-up.
    - Search using wildcard is now possible
      `Router router = Router()`
      `router.addRoute("/foo", "foo")`
      `router.addRoute("/bar/*/baz", "bar")`
      `router.callRoute("/bar/a/baz") -> bar`
      Here the solution needed Trie. I suggested the same and interviewer said it was the right solution here. This trie
      needs to be implemented by splitting the route by slash and keeping each word as a trieNode.

3. ### System design question - 1 question
    - Design a system where you return top confluence pages for the home screen. Top is decided by some metric say likes. The top screen needs to refreshed when new top posts come in. The top suggestions page should be renderable in any device, mobile, tablet, desktop. Final follow-up was about user recommendation since I clarified in my FR that this is going to all time top posts and not based on user recommendations.

4. ### Managerial round - experience and behavioural questions.
    - Generic behavioural questions but a [useful resource](https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/values-interviewing-atlassian.pdf)

5. ### Values round - behavioural questions.
    - Similar to above. Managerial is more about your experience and projects while values is more behavioural, I guess.

## Final call: No hire, despite green (hire call) on all rounds

I recently explored the system design of a scalable tagging service, inspired by platforms like Instagram hashtags, Atlassian document tags, and Twitter trends. This was a deep-dive exercise—part of sharpening my system design skills for staff-level interviews (and beyond!).

# Problem Statement
Design a system where:

Users can tag posts/documents
Tags can be searched, auto-completed, recommended
System can identify trending tags in real-time
Must support billions of mappings across posts & tags

![design .png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f213f0a2-b3c4-47f5-be7f-723f3e988db0_1751292243.3188262.png)

# Key Functional Requirements
Apply and remove tags from posts
Search and autocomplete tags with millisecond latency
Fetch paginated posts for a given tag
Recommend tags while creating content
Identify & rank trending tags in real-time

# Key Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <50ms for autocomplete/recommendations
Availability: Highly available writes and reads
Scalability: Billions of tags/posts, millions of QPS
Consistency: Read-your-own-write for tags on posts
Abuse protection: Detect and handle spammy tags

# Interesting Design Problems I Tackled
**Reverse Mapping Challenge**
Why we use both post_to_tag and tag_to_post tables — to enable custom sharding (e.g., by tag + time) and support high-throughput tag queries.

**Trending Tags at Scale**
Why we use both post_to_tag and tag_to_post tables — to enable custom sharding (e.g., by tag + time) and support high-throughput tag queries.

**Autocomplete with Typos**
Leveraged Elasticsearch FST (finite state transducers) and prefix tries for fast, typo-tolerant tag lookup.


**Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**
Estimated writes/reads/day, QPS, storage per mapping, and TTL strategy for retention. Proved design viability under realistic load.

Other Offers: I do not currently hold any other offers.


I had a few questions regarding the compensation process at Atlassian and would really appreciate any insights:

- Does Atlassian typically ask for expected compensation at this stage?
- If they do, how much should I quote considering my background and current comp?
- If they don’t ask and directly share an offer, what’s the best way to approach negotiations?
- Does Atlassian offer a sign-on bonus?
- What is a reasonable total compensation to expect at P40 level for ~6 YOE?

Any guidance from folks who’ve been through this process would be greatly appreciated!

P.S. I’ll share a detailed post on my overall interview experience in a separate thread soon.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Leetcoders, I am posting my interview experience with LinkedIn India for the Staff Software Engineer role. For the Staff role, they have total of 6 rounds: 1 Screening and 5 online rounds

Here is the breakdown of all the rounds:

**Round 1: Screening**

In this round, Firstly, I was asked to give my detailed career intro along with leadership/project related questions:

1. Conflicting situations faced in any critical project
2. Impactful project from which I was able to move out to other project with minimal disruption

Few follow-ups were there and this discussion lasted for around 20 mins

Then, I got a LC Hard DSA question : https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/
I discussed 2-3 most optimal approaches and the interviewer agreed on one of the approaches to code it for all the helper methods along with discussion on Space and Time Complexity. Also, I was asked to dry run on a pre-written TC.

Rating : Strong Hire

**Round 2: DSA 1: Staff Coding - Apps**

Q1: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring
The problem was extended to a condition when the source string is wrapped around.

Q2: Shortest path between LinkedIn connections. An adjacency list is given, a source and a target. Find the connection distance between source and target. Print the path as well.
I discussed the optimal solution : Bi-directional BFS and coded for the same.

Rating : Strong Hire


**Round 3: DSA 2: Staff Coding & Algorithms 2**

Q1: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder
I gave the most optimized O(M*N) approach inspired by the below link:
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/1595132398

Q2: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii
Gave the optimal 2-pointer approach.
Extension: For the scenario if one string's occurences are less than other, used binary search for the more frequent string.

Rating : Strong Hire

**Round 4: System Design**

Initially, this round started with project and leadership based questions. Don't remember the exact questions, Apologies.
Next, the interviewer covered the most complex project I recently led and covered about the security aspects and challenges faced. There were multiple follow-ups to understand my roles and responsibilities working as a tech lead.

Next, I was given the below system design problem:

Design a flexible in-memory cache with customizable capacity and eviction policies.

The cache should allow users to define:
1.  Capacity: Specify how much data the cache can hold based on memory resources and data size.
2.  Eviction Policy: Choose strategies for removing items when the cache is full, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Lowest Priority.

This flexibility ensures the cache can be tailored to meet specific requirements, balancing resource usage and performance.

Once the LLD created was agreed with the interviewer, it was extended from HLD perspective for multiple nodes in distributed system setup covering all the challenges and other adhoc scenarios like hot key issue for a write-heavy setup. Also, discussion went around few Redis related internals.

Rating : Hire

**Round 5: Craftsmanship**

This is mostly a behavioral based round for Staff role. It covered 8-10 scenario questions with internal follow ups. Questions were as follows:

-> How do you define a quality product/system?
-> Describe your strategy regarding code reviews
-> Talk about a project that had many junior engineers and how I kept the project quality high/ If your team keeps growing and you get more junior engineers, what do you do?
-> As a hypothetical situation, Imagine you join LinkedIn on a massive team that owns a legacy application. The application lacks adequate testing and monitoring and has slow response times. Consumers complain about this. Deployment of the application often contains bugs. What efforts would you do as a Staff SWE?
-> Rank the following in terms of priority: bugs, no testing, no monitoring, slowness. What do you tackle first? How do you eventually turn this into micro services?
-> What do you look for when determining the success of a service?
-> What are your principles of mentorship? How do you manage technical and non-technical mentorship?
-> Talk about a time where you helped grow engineers
-> Few questions which were aligning with the LinkedIn values. Don't remember the exact questions.
Note: Please be well-versed about Linkedin values.

**Round 6: Host Manager**

This round started with an elaborate introduction of both me and the interviewer.

Questions were as follows:
1. Talk in detail about the most complex and challenging project I led in the recent times which had a very large scale. I framed my answer step-by-step as follows (along with few follow-ups from the HM):
   -> Team and My role
   -> Customer Problem & Business impact
   -> Key architectural decisions led/taken by me
   -> Biggest challenges faced and how did I overcome
   -> How did I maintain timely execution of the project
   -> Changes in reqs/unexpected blockers
   -> Ensuring alignment with stakeholders

2. Why looking for change? Why LinkedIn?
3. Describe a situation where you showed operational excellence.
4. Describe a situation where you suggested improvements in the project which other engineers in the team could leverage from.

Then at the end, he threw a HLD problem for designing a LinkedIn internal notification system which can handle a very large scale.
There were few cross-questions regarding the different internal microservices and Kafka being used for async handling.
This just had 10-15 mins at the end. Luckily, I was able to create the HLD diagram covering all the components.

**Verdict** : Selected for the staff role after a week.

**Compensation details :**
Base salary: 88 LPA
Target bonus : 13.2 LPA (min 15%)
PF : 4.25 LPA
RSU: 350k for 4 years (75.5 LPA)
Relocation bonus/services: ~ 5-7 L
Net CTC per year : 1.85 Cr PA (++ unlimited LinkedIn Perks)
YOE : 10
Current CTC : 63 LPA (Microsoft : Senior SWE)

Had another competing offers from Salesforce and Atlassian (~1.4 Cr PA), but finally I accepted the LinkedIn offer due to a better role and compensation.

Thanks to the Leetcode community for helping during my preparation and it's my time to give back to the community. Cheers!
