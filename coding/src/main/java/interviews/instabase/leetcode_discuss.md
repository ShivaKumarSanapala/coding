Hey everyone,

Hope you\'re doing well. I\'m reaching out because I could really use some advice and support right now. I\'m currently in my third year and I\'ve applied for a position at Instabase. It\'s a big opportunity for me, and I want to make sure I\'m as prepared as possible.

I\'ve been diving deep into machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) - revisiting concepts, practicing, and making sure I\'m up to speed with the latest developments. On top of that, I\'m also brushing up on my data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills. I know these are crucial for interviews, especially at a company like Instabase.

I primarily work with Python, which has been my go-to for ML/DL tasks. But I\'m always on the lookout for ways to improve my Python skills, especially any tricks or techniques that could give me an edge.

If any of you have been through this process or have insights to share, I\'d really appreciate your advice. Specifically, I\'m looking for tips on which DSA topics to focus on and any Python hacks that could come in handy.

And if you could spare a moment to send some positive vibes my way, I\'d be incredibly grateful.

Thanks so much for your help and support.
