**Timeline**

8 Weeks Training + Classes – Before the assessment, we had structured training covering DSA, OOPs, DBMS, OS, Java, and problem-solving.

Final Assessment – Conducted after the 8 weeks of classes.

**Venue**: KL University

**Reporting Time**: 8:00 AM

**Interview Call**: Received at 4:00 PM

**Interview Duration**: ~1 hour

**Interview Panel**: Two interviewers (one virtual, one in-person).

**Technical Questions**

The panel asked me to start with a self-introduction and then moved into core technical areas.

- Method Overloading vs. Overriding

- Exception Handling in Java

- Difference between Checked vs. Unchecked exceptions

- What is a Null Pointer Exception and how to handle it?

- Difference between final, finally, finalize

- Explain FIFO principle

- Basics of Multithreading

- What is a HashMap and how it is implemented internally?

- What is a Set and difference between List vs. Set

- Language Preference: C++ vs. Java – why choose C++?

- Data types in C++

- Memory size of int in C++ and Java

- What is an API and its usage

- What is REST API

**Coding Questions**

- **I was asked to solve two problems on the spot:**

- Reverse a String

- Merge Two Maps

**HR Questions**

Some HR-related questions included:

- Which city do you belong to?

- Explain about your city.

- Are you willing to relocate?

- Are you comfortable with shifts?

- If new programming languages emerge in the future, will you be able to learn them?

**Overall Experience**:

The interview panel was friendly and tested both technical depth (OOPs, Java, C++ concepts, APIs, collections, multithreading) and coding ability (basic but tricky).

The HR questions mainly checked for flexibility and adaptability.

The process tested concept clarity + problem-solving + communication.

It was a good learning experience and lasted about an hour.

**Tip for Juniors**: Revise OOPs, Exception Handling, Collections, APIs, and DSA basics. Be confident in whichever language you choose (C++ or Java). Also, practice simple coding problems like string manipulation and map operations.

**Loop Interviews** : All rounds happened on the same day a week after giving OA.

**Round 2: Problem Solving** (DSA) (60 minutes)

Interviewer mentioned 2 questions are to be solved in this round. Expectation was to write production ready code and provide testcases as well. However, I could solve only 1 question before time ran out.

Q: Given a string and a vector of string of random `[start,end]` positions, we need to place bold tags: `<b> at start` and `</b> at end`.

https://leetcode.com/problems/add-bold-tag-in-string/description/

Handled overlapping intervals by merging them. Implemented end to end optimal code and came up with testcases other than those which interviewer provided. Discussed some edge cases and code worked for all scenarios. Discussed TC and SC.

Interviewer provided no hints/suggestions and was silent throughout.

[Self Verdict: Lean Hire]

**Round 3: Problem Solving** (DSA) (60 minutes)

Q1: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/description/

Discussed brute force and optimal approach in detail with interviewer with dry run. Once we both agreed to the solution coded up working solution. Wrote testcases and discussed minor improvements for edge cases. Discussed TC.

Q2: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/

Discussed lexicographical approach then interviewer asked to think of several testcases and dry run them. Figured out the problem with my initial approach and discussed optimal approach with merge sort and heap sort. Wrote the recursive call tree for a sample case. Discussed TC and recursive call SC. Coding was not asked for this question.

Q3: Explain BFS and DFS and discuss when to use.

Discussed the traversal algorithms and data structures for implementation. Discussed about infinite branch problem of DFS. Discussed custom traversal approach based on some heuristic combining BFS and DFS for faster convergence like IDDFS. Also went through real-world use cases of such algorithms like BFS for social network analysis.

Overall had lots of insightful discussion and interviewer was super friendly and helpful. Discussed the impact and use cases of AI for a SWE at Microsoft.

[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]

**Round 4: AA | Hiring Manager** (Behavioural+System Design) (60 minutes)

Interviewer started with asking some behavioural questions regarding why thinking of job change and why Microsoft. Discussed about some areas of interest and past work experience.

Q: Low Level Design of Snake and Ladder Game
Requirements:
R1: Board has NxM positions, cannot go beyond boundaries.
R2: K players each rolling dice in round robin format.
R3: Implement snakes and ladders. Both cannot be at same position.
R4: Player needs to roll a 6 to start.
R5: Rolling a 6 gives second chance to roll dice.
R6: Three consecutive 6 means chance cancelled.
R7: If roll is invalid turn goes over to next player.
R8: Game concludes when any player reaches last position.

Implemented all the requirements. Wrote structured classes, functions and data structures for players, position, board, and gameplay. Discussed some optimizations of time and space and implemented them. Interviewer pointed out some edge cases and made required edits.

Had some time leftover and interviewer was in Copilot team so got a chance to discuss the latest developments of AI and LLM happening inside Microsoft and what might be coming next.

[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]

---

**Final Verdict** 🎉

Got verbal offer and document submission mail within 3 working days. Written offer was released after another week.

Overall the process was smooth and very fast. Interviewers and recruiters were prompt and helpful.

# 👋 Hey everyone!
# I’m Shivam Dubey — on a mission to sharpen my coding interview skills by actively solving problems on LeetCode.

While practicing, I had a big realization:
👉 Most problems aren’t completely random… they actually follow a handful of core patterns.

Once I started focusing on these patterns, everything clicked:

🔹 Complex problems felt easier to break down

## Full Content

I got a chance to interview at NVIDIA for their SSE Internship role!
Nvidia visited my campus for this role.

**Round-1:** *Online Assessment:* (60 minutes)
This was conducted offline by our campus placement cell. It consisted of multiple aptitude, C language and 2 coding questions. Questions were doable, prepare for pointers. Since this round was easy, getting selected for interview was highly competetitive.  
I was able to clear this round along with four other batch-mates.
(i was from Electrical and others were from CSE, so maybe branch plays a role in getting selecting for this, i am not quite sure)

**Round-2** *Technical-Interview:* (55-60 minutes)
This was an online video call interview with two people as panelists. This round was highly technical-conceptual interview.
Have a strong hold on your projects, and you should know everything you have implemented for the project you are explaining. This is a must for all companies. I got rejected from Gold-Sachs because of this reason :( You can learn it in an un-hard way :)
It needs low-level requirements of machine, like memory management, pointers, C/C++, datatypes, values and understanding of basic concepts in depth, be it integer overflow, pointers, fucntion calls, or the resource management, addressing modes.

Apart from that, what gave me an edge over my batchmates was knowing operating systems, i would 100% recommend you to read basic OS concepts, synchronisation, mutex, locks, (hands on is an add-on), functionality, understanding, race conditions, user-mode-kernel mode, semaphores, scheduling, CPU functionality, threads, critical section, everything. I am an Electrical undergrad hence i prepared this topic myself. You can refer CodeHelp's pdf notes and a senior to guide you to prepare for these topics! (This helps a lot, since they have more idea and have explored quite a lot!)

There were two-dsa questions, not very tough and doable, it depends on the interviewer but for a rough idea, i have solved around 600 questions on leetcode and have a strong hold on approaches clicking instantly. (Def prepare for DSA for all companies, it will 100% help you, so dont miss this out)

Also prepare answers for questions like why SSE? Nvidia? and why should i take you, etc.

This round went pretty nice, i was able to answer most of the questions and confidently! Prepare well for these topics.
Got accepted! :)

Just keep going, after getting the worst rejections, you will make it somewhere great!
Just need to focus and manifest your target xD
Good things are on the way and everything will make sense and fall in place! Just keep pushing yourself.

## Full Content

Background:

- 2025 graduate from a Tier-1 college (IIT), Circuit Branch.

- Placed as Embedded Software Engineer (Tech Stack - C) at a mid-sized PBC (had to accept due to placement policies, not my ideal role).

- Interested in SDE/SWE roles (PBCs).

- Decent hands-on in Full Stack Development (multiple projects, some live).

- DSA level: Good (~800+ LeetCode problems solved).

Current Situation:

I have been actively applying and trying for SDE/SWE roles for some time, but with the current market scenario, I haven’t been getting any positives so far. It’s getting a bit draining, and I am unsure whether I should continue trying or pivot.

My Confusion:

I am torn between:

1️⃣ Keep grinding DSA + system design + projects and continue applying for SDE/SWE roles while working.
2️⃣ Prepare for Masters in CS from top Indian colleges (IISc, Top 3-4 IITs) to pivot cleanly into SDE roles.
3️⃣ Foreign Masters is an option but lower priority due to family constraints.

Why Masters came to my mind:
I don’t have a clear idea how difficult it will be to switch from embedded to SDE after 1–2 years of experience in embedded. I fear that spending 1–2 years might make it harder to break into SDE later without a formal CS degree & experience.


What would you do in this scenario?
If you were in my shoes, would you keep trying for SDE roles in this market or invest 1-2 years in a Masters to pivot strongly?

Any perspectives from people who have made similar decisions recently in this market would be highly appreciated!

- Online assessment - All students who were in circuital branch having CGPA of >= 8.0 were selected for it.
- Out of all eligible students 20 students were selected for first round of interview and I was one of them.
- First round was DSA round questions.They asked two DSA questions. One was literally hard and other is medium-hard level. I was able to solve the hard one with graph+DP concept. And able to solve medium-hard problem by taking some hints from interviewer.
- Result- Out of 20 only 10 were selected for the next round i.e Round 2.
- Round 2 was system design round.They asked me few concepts in system design like query optimization, Caching, Indexing, API's design,etc. and then give to design a system.
- They want to take 4 round but due to lack of time they announced the result on the basis of these 2 rounds only.
- Result [Rejected] -> Only 5 were selected for this and I was rejected. I don't how they selected. Both rounds were good for me.
  If you can guess how they were selected then you can give comments in this also.

According to me selection was on the basis of total score obtain by candidates from both rounds.

Couldnt give NQT because of internship in one of them. Got my desired tech stack which Java , spring boot during internship and probably will be assigned to a project in a month as I turn into a Fte. Declined the offer of second job because they didn't mention anything about tech stack or if I'll get a project post Fte.
Currently I'm looking for off campus opportunities. Building microservice enabled full stack spring boot projects. Doing leetcode aggressively. Focusing more on microservice, docker, cloud. Currently working with docker, kafka and other technologies.
Need suggestions on how can I switch, where to focus more. Is there any chance for off campus now, whom should I reach out.
Also if roadmap as java developer is correct and will help in future.

## Full Content

I recently gave the Infosys SP-DSE OA where there were three DSA problems based on math, greedy, combinatorics and graph.

# 🔹 Question 1:

In the enchanted forest, Pious found a straight magical vine with N glowing berries of different colors: The colours of berries are represented by lowercase letters such that Magical Vine[i] represents the colour of the berry i.

Pious wanted to gather the first few berries from the vine to craft a special bracelet for his best friend, Gala.

Gala loves symmetric patterns, so Pious wants the berries on the bracelet to follow a repeating design. A sequence of berries S is considered magical if it can be represented as:


S = P+Q+P+Q+P+...+P+Q+P

where:

- P and Q are berry color sequences.

- The sequence must have (2K + 1) parts, with (K + 1) copies of P and K copies of Q placed alternately.

- Either P or Q (or both) can be empty.

Pious needs your help to figure out which initial segments of the vine form a magical pattern and how many magical segments are possible.

Find the total number of ways in which Pious can cut the first few berries from the branch such that they form a magical pattern.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of berries on the vine.

The next line contains an integer, K, described in the problem.

The next line contains a string, Magical, Vine, denoting the colors of all the berries.

**Constraints**

1 <= N <= 10^6

1 <= K <= 10^6

N <= len(Magical Vine) <= N

**Sample Test Cases**
**Case 1**

**Input**
4
1
abcd

**Output**
4

**Explanation**
N=7, K=2

s = "pqpqpqp"

The magical sequence can be the first 4 berries: "papa"

We can take P = "", Q = "pq"

→ P appears 3 times (K+1), Q appears 2 times (K)

The magical sequence can be the first 5 berries: "pqpqp"

We can take P = "p", Q = "q" → P appears 3 times (K+1), Q appears 2 times (K)

The magical sequence can be the first 6 berries: "pqpqpq"

We can take P = "pq", Q = ""

→ P appears 3 times (K+1), Q appears 2 times (K)

So, 3 ways are possible.

**Case 2**

**Input**
7
2
xyzxyz

**Output**
1

**Case 3**

**Input**
7
2
pqpqpqp

**Output**
3

```
public class Solution {
    public static int Gala_Pious(int N, int K, String Magical_Vine) {
        // Write your code here
    }
}
```
# 🔹 Question 2:

You are given an array A of length N.
The value of a subsegment is calculated by multiplying all the values in that subsegment, for example the value of (2, 3, 5) is 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.

Find the total number of ways to partition the array A into consecutive subsegments that cover all elements such that the value of each subsegment is divisible by at least X factors.
Since the number of ways can be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in A.

The next line contains an integer X, denoting the number of factors the value of a subsegment must have.

Each of the next N subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < N) contains an integer describing A[i].

**Constraints**

1 <= N <= 10^5
2 <= X <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^5

**Sample Test Cases**
**Case 1**

**Input**
2
2
2
2

**Output**
2

**Explanation**
N=2, X=2, A=[2, 2]

There are two ways to partition the array:

- [2], [2]. Product of each = 2, which has factors {1, 2}.

- [2, 2]. Product is 4. The number of factors of 4 is more than 2.

**Case 2**

**Input**
3
5
2
6
8

**Output**
1

**Explanation**
A=[2,6,8], N=3, X=5

The only way is to take the whole array as a single subsegment.

2 * 6 * 8 = 96. Number of factors of 96 is more than 5.

**Case 3**

**Input**
5
3
2
2
3
2
2

**Output**
3

**Explanation**
N=5, X=3, A=[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]

There are three ways to partition this array:

- [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]

- [2, 2], [3, 2, 2]

- [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]

```
public class Solution {
    public static int getCount(int N, int X, List<Integer> A) {
        // Write your code here
    }
}
```

# 🔹 Question 3:

The kingdom of Eldoria was a land of unity, where its N sacred cities were connected through a vast network of enchanted bridges. Each city was a stronghold of knowledge and power.

However, an ancient saga shattered the harmony of Eldoria, causing the bridges to break randomly and leaving the kingdom divided into isolated regions.

The Great Oracle of Eldoria has foreseen a way to restore balance. He must study every possible subset of cities and count the total number of ways they can be split into exactly X isolated realms, where X is a prime number.

For every prime number X from 1 to N, the Oracle must:

- Determine the number of ways to choose a non-empty group of cities such that the bridges between them create exactly X separate connected realms.

- Sum up all prime values of X that contribute to the valid configurations.

Find the total number of valid ways for each prime number X from 1 to N.


**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of cities.

Each of the next N subsequent lines (where 1 ≤ i ≤ N) contains an integer describing Cities[i].

**Constraints**

1 <= N <= 5000
1 <= Cities[i] < i

**Sample Test Cases**
**Case 1**

**Input**
3
-1
1
1

**Output**
1

**Explanation**
N=3, Cities=[-1,1,1]
For prime X=2: result=1
For prime X=3: result=0
Only subset {2,1} forms exactly 2 connected components.
Total = 1.

**Case 2**

**Input**
4
-1
1
1
1

**Output**
4

**Explanation**
N=4, Cities=[-1,1,1,1]
X=2, result=3 (subsets: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4))
X=3, result=1 (subset: (2,3,4))
Total=3+1=4.

**Case 3**

**Input**
4
-1
1
2
1

**Output**
5

**Explanation**
N=4, Cities=[-1,1,2,1]
X=2, result=5 (subsets: (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4))
X=3, result=0
Total=5+0=5.

Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out for some advice. I have 2 years of experience as a ReactJS developer at HCLTECH, and I've also worked on some freelancing projects. Despite my background in a tier 2 college (EEE branch), I've managed to build a solid foundation in ReactJS and DSA.

Recently, I've been applying to top companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, and Flexport, but unfortunately, I've been facing rejections. My resume scores 85 on ATS platforms, which seems decent, but I'm struggling to understand why I'm not getting through.

If anyone has experience or insights on what might be going wrong, I'd greatly appreciate your guidance. Are there specific skills or experiences that these companies are looking for? Any tips on improving my resume or interview preparation would be super helpful.

# **Worst Experience Ever**
**Juspay Interview Experience**
📌 Opportunity: On-Campus (Open to All Branches)
Position: SDE Intern – Backend
College tier-3
Compensation- 27Lpa

I cleared 5 rounds and finally reached the last round of the interview. This was supposed to be a system design round. The HR had informed me that the interview would consist of questions from OS, DBMS, Computer Science fundamentals, and OOPs—essentially core subjects.

Firstly, the interviewer joined 1.5 hours late. When he finally joined, he said, “Please allow me 2 minutes, I need to use the washroom.” I politely said, “Go ahead, sir.”

When he returned, the first thing he asked was, “Do you know how a toilet flush works?”
Honestly, I didn’t know the technical workings, but I had seen some Harpic advertisements on TV. So, I tried to answer by saying, “Sir, I think there's some rubber mechanism that holds water, and when we press the flush button, it releases the water.”

To that, he bluntly replied, “Nahi aata to chup raho” (If you don’t know, keep your mouth shut).
I understand that if I didn’t know the answer, I should have stayed quiet—but I thought giving a logical guess or intuition might show I'm trying.

Then he asked me my favorite subject. I replied with a core subject that I enjoy. But he interrupted and said, “Not from your core or engineering subjects.” So I told him, “Sir, space fascinates me.”
His counter-question was, “If you're stuck on a planet like Earth, how would you build a spaceship using only Earth’s resources?”
I admitted honestly, “Sir, I don't know, I’m from the CSE branch,” especially since at the beginning of the interview he himself said, “If you don’t know the answer, don’t try to answer.”

Next, he shared his screen and showed 8 components. He asked me to build a steam engine using them. Again, I said, “Sorry sir, I don't know.”

He said, “No worries, let’s move to your technical skills.”
Then he asked me how a HashMap works in O(1) time complexity. Since I use Java, I explained how HashMaps work both before and after Java 8.

After that, he simply said, your interview is over.”

The next day, 6 students from our college reached the final round. 5 of them received offer letters and PPOs worth 27 LPA. I was the only one rejected.

Below is a summary of the interview process I cleared till Round 5. Thanks.

Note to Juspay (or any senior officials who might see this):
Please ensure fairness and professionalism during interviews. This entire process spanned 2 months, and I dedicated myself wholeheartedly—averaging only 5–6 hours of sleep daily. To be treated like this in the final round was deeply disheartening. Students work extremely hard to reach this stage, and interviews should be an opportunity to evaluate—not humiliate.



# Round 1: Online Coding Assessment

# 🧪 Interview Experience

✅ **Online Assessment** | 24th Feb (90 min)
Questions: 2 DSA questions + amazon Behavioral questions(MCQs)

Result: I applied to different position but it got filled, So they considered my test score for different position and i got call to schedule interview after approx 2 months.
PS: really had forgot about amazon till now.

📲 **Phone screen** (Elimination round) | May 09 (1 hr)
Questions:
```
Q1: Given two strings str and pattern, return an array of all the start indices of pattern's anagrams in str.
Input: str = "acbadabcaa", pattern = "aabc" Output: [0,5,6] Explanation:

The substring with start index = 0 is "acba", which is an anagram of "aabc". 
The substring with start index = 5 is "abca", which is an anagram of "aabc". 
The substring with start index = 6 is "bcaa", which is an anagram of "aabc".

Q2: Given an `m x n` grid of `0` (Water) and `1` (Land), the task is to count the number of islands. 
An island is a group of adjacent `1` cells connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, 
and it is surrounded by water or the grid boundary. The goal is to determine how many distinct islands exist in the grid.

Input: grid[][] = 
[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],  
 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],  
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  
 [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]]

Number of Islands = 4
```
Result: After 6 days, on May 15, I was informed moving forward to loop interview.
PS: they call it phone screening, really it is dsa round.

**Information on Loop Interview and LP**
- **Loop interview** is basically non-elimination rounds,
  where each round will consist of 45 min for tech questions (DSA/LLD/HLD) + 15 min for Leadership principles (2 LPs).

- **Leadership principles** questions are basically HR questions related to 14 principles amazon follow. HR typically mails more info about this and how to prepare around this before loop interview. I have covered more about it below.
  *Approach these questions with STAR method(Situation, Task, Actions, Results) and from  your past work experience prepare a story about each principle.*
  PS: They dont ask LP questions directly, it would be more of statement and you would have to figure it out whether which LP is applicable. They take LPs very seriously, one of my friend got rejected due to it.

- Before scheduling Loop Interviews, they asked me my available dates plus number of rounds i am comfortable with in a day to which i replied 1 interview max a day.

PS: Currently amazon is hiring in drives, and they may conduct 3 rounds a day, which really is good, if you want to get it over with.
I personally like to take my time and 1 round is enough to make me tired. You can always request to your HR for time, if you prefer like me.

🔢 **Loop Interview Round 1 - DSA Round** | 23rd May (1 hr)

```
Q1. There are N poles of various heights, and you have a machine whose saw blade can be set at a specific height "h" 
and it cuts all poles till that height, such that all of them have height "h" after the cut. 
(Poles with height less than "h" remain uncut). You take away the cut portions of all poles with you.

Your task is to take at least M length of poles with you in total after the cut. 
What is the maximum height 'h' where you can set your blade to achieve this.

N = 4
M = 7
arr = [20, 15, 10, 17]
```
2 LPs:
1. Ownership
2. I dont really remember

Self Verdict:
Interview went well, really got lucky with BS question. And this was the only round where LP also went well. So i was confident despite initial 10 mins wasted.

Note for DSA round: Time and space complexity, they ask proper 5-10 mins and cross question a lot on how we can improve.

PS: My electricity went out and I lost first 10 mins, they asked me whether i want to reschedule because i would only get 50 mins now, but i said i am good as I already had waited long for this day. Really was scared but interviewers were nice and understood to situation.

🏗 **Loop Interview Round 2 - Low-Level Design (LLD)** | 28th May (1 hr)
```
Problem: Design Meeting and room reservation system
Approach: It went like typical LLD, I was thinking how i schedule Meetings in teams and outlook.
1. started with requirement gathering
2. Then Made rough flow
3. Identified Objects
4. coded all the classes and code.

It was not a working code. It was more like UML diagram just in codepad. 
So i made all the classes and talked about all is and has relation ships and then created all variables and methods used. 
At the end of it i explained how a good flow would go. 
He was conversing with me throughout, and at the end he asked me what design pattern more i could have used which I already wanted to talk about if i had more time.
```
2 LPs:
1. Bias for Action
2. Disagree and commit

Self verdict:
LLD went well, I was pretty confident, although problem was new but i was preparing for last 4 days for LLD only full day. In LP, he cross questioned alot, but i was able to answer.

---

🧱 **Loop Interview Round 3 - Bar Raiser** | 3rd June (1 hr)

I was told it would be like coding/DSA, but it was more like LLD and coding mix. Question was very open ended and the purpose was to I feel see how would I approach a problem in real world when described by users.

```
Initial Problem Statement: code a way to find available space to  store incoming packages.

Initial requirement gathering took 10-15 mins to understand what really i wanted to code here. (hard part)
Then coding part and follow up questions were done (easy part)

Approach:
1. Firstly discussion went on how would we can categorize different containers based on size. 
2. I was thinking in terms of volume but as some packages might fit volume and violate height/length/breadth req. 
3. So eventually, we came with pre defined sizes of lockers like (S, M, L, Xl, XXL) and user could choose his package would fit in which category. 
4. Thinking input variable for method was the hardest part.
5. Then I quicly coded 3 methods, find Locker, add locker, update locker(put/remove package).
6. then discusion went around which data structures i have used and why. and what can i improve in time and space complexity.

```

2 LPs:
1. Insist on High Standards
2. Think Big

Self verdict:
First Half of interview was very tough, The question seemed vague, But then with disussion picture got cleared. I was not very confident with this round and top of it he really grilled me on LP questions very hard.

---

💡 **Loop Interview Round 4 - High Level Design (HLD)** | 9th June (1 hr)

```
Problem Stat: Design a system which allows us to sync configuration from old to new device

Device could be anything, phone, alexa, home devices. 
I have listed down my req. gathering part which i did as this was not a usual question. 
But I followed the way how we approach HLD, after req. gathering, listed down APIs,
and remebered a rough flow of how we setup a new phone and that helped me. 
Discussion over APIs and database was very good. 
And he asked a question around how we can reduce our storage. 
And answer to this was we can eliminate cloud storage for configurations file totally and pull it from old device at the time of setup. 

Functional req.
Sync old to new device: 
1. should be able to choose and login to account 
2. preference on default apps
3. New device should be ready to use

NFR:
Security
Scalable 
performant (1-5 mins)

Entities:
Device (old, new)
User
Settings/configuration
```

2 LPs:
1. Customer Obsession
2. Dive Deep

Self Verdict:
Design went well, he was happy with my design and optimization for storage, but in LPs he roasted me but i answered to my best.


---


📝 **Overall Verdict: Selected**. Got call at 17th June.

**Note:** I have given such a detailed experience to help you understand the expectations. Plus I have also given timelines to understand how it could be time taking process for few people. I have tried to include all pointers which i personally searched through other interview experiences to get clarity. I know this was a long read, but I hope this is helpful!

**💭 My final thoughts:**

I think I would have got lucky at few instances like DSA question in round 1 but believe me in every round I was on my toes. Preping DSA+LLD+HLD+LP was a great deal, I only focused on interview preps during this timeline, and literally ditched everything else. Interview experience was quite good and i enjoyed learning LLD and HLD during this time. I separately sat for preping examples for LP around whole 1-2 days and before every round i gave 2 hrs to revise. Since its a MAANG it was a great deal for me.

Thanks in advance, and happy to receive feedback/suggestions and answer any follow-up questions!

Hi everyone,
I’m a final-year Electronics & Telecommunication (ENTC) engineering student actively applying for SDE roles as a fresher. I wanted to share my experience and get some advice from this amazing community.

📌 My Current Situation:
✅ I’m consistently clearing coding and aptitude rounds across different companies, which has really boosted my confidence.

❌ Some companies (Accenture, ICICI, Wipro - probably) stopped hiring after conducting interviews and haven’t released any results, which left me stuck without feedback.

❌ I’ve faced rejections in interviews with Edgeverve, IBM, and TCS.

⚙️ For some companies, I’m not eligible because of my 12th percentage (I have 68%).

📆 I’ve also faced eligibility issues due to a 1-year gap caused by COVID.

🎓 Since I’m from a non-CS branch (ENTC), I’ve noticed limited opportunities or additional barriers at some companies.

🌱 What’s Going Well:
I’ve realized that clearing coding and aptitude rounds consistently is a good sign, and I’m steadily improving my technical skills

I’m genuinely trying to understand why this is happening and what I can do to finally get my first job.

If anyone has faced this or can share some real advice, please help me out 🙏

Thank you so much for reading!
If anyone has gone through similar struggles or has suggestions, your input would mean a lot to me. 🙏😊

# **Topological Sort**
- Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u->v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
- Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

- DFS way, (TC - O(V + E) & SC - O(V))
- Idea: node/vertex that comes at last must be present at last. Hence, the idea is to store last visited at bottom. Thus, Stack comes into picture.
- Algorithm,
    - Make visited Array to tackle both disconnected & visited nodes.
    - Call DFS on each unvisited node
        - Call DFS on unvisited Neighbours
        - After making all calls to Neighbours Store current Node in a Stack.
    - Finally, pop all the elements of stack into resultant Vector
```
class Solution {
    public static void recursiveDFS(int v, List<Integer>[] adj, boolean[] visited, Stack<Integer> stack) {
        visited[v] = true;
        for (int i : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                recursiveDFS(i, adj, visited, stack);
            }
        }
        stack.push(v);
    }

    public static ArrayList<Integer> topoSort(int V, int[][] edges) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[V];
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        //adding all the vertices
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);

- Topological Sort - BFS way (Kahn's Algorithm), (TC - O(V + E) & SC - O(V))
- Idea : The idea is that all nodes which will be at starting will have indegree 0.
- Algorithm,
    - Store Indegree of all nodes in Array.
    - Push nodes in Queue whose indegree == 0.
    - Now, For each node in Queue.
        - Pop the current node & Store into resultant Array
        - Remove indegree count of all neighbours of current node.
        - If neighbours indegree becomes 0 then push into queue.
    - Finally, return resultant Array.
    - Here, Visited Array does not come into the picture.

- Dijkstra [Greedy] - Single Source Shorted Path (SSSP) [Solve it using PriorityQueue + DFS] - Fail on Negative Edge Weight and TLE on Negative Weight Cycle. - Works on both directed and undirected graph with non-negative edge weights

    - This alorithm can handle any negative edges graph except the following cases,
        - Directed graph having any negative cycle (cycle with sum < 0)
        - Undirected graph having any negative edge because an edge in undirected graph is itself a cycle.
    - TC - O(ElogV) and SC - O(V+E)
    - Can be Implemented with Queue > PriorityQueue (Min-Heap) > Set {The order is according to execution of implementing this algorithm with this particular data structure}

- Bellman-Ford [DP] - Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) - This can handle Negative Edge Weight and Negative Weight Cycle - Works on both directed and undirected graph with non-negative edge weights as well as directed graph with negative edge weights as long as no negative cycles are present.
- The Bellman-Ford algorithm can detect negative weight cycles, but it cannot find shortest paths in a graph containing them. While it can handle negative edge weights, if a negative cycle is present, the algorithm will continue to find shorter paths indefinitely as it loops through the cycle, indicating the absence of a true shortest path.

- Floyd-Warshall [DP] - Multiple Sources Shortest Path (MPSP) - All Pair Shortest Path (APSP) - This can handle Negative Edge Weight, but this algorithm can't handle Negative Weight Cycle.
- No, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm cannot handle negative weight cycles. While it can work with negative edge weights, it will not produce correct shortest path results if a negative cycle is present in the graph. The presence of a negative cycle means that repeatedly traversing the cycle would lead to arbitrarily small path costs, making a shortest path undefined.

    - If the provided Graph does not contain the Negative Weight Cycle, then We can apply Dijkstra on every Individual node/vertex to find out the All Pairs Shortest Path [TC - O(V* ElogV)]

# **To find the MST - Minimum Spanning Tree for directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted and connected graph,**

- MST : connect all the nodes with minimum costs (n nodes // n-1 edges).

- Prim's [Greedy] - DFS - Starts from a single vertex and grows the MST - build the MST by starting from any node and expanding the tree one edge at a time.
- Prim’s = P = "Pull nearest neighbor" [PriorityQueue + DFS]
- Think: Prim pulls the closest node using a Priority Queue
- Start from a node, grow by picking the smallest edge to unvisited node

| **Rank**    | Approximate depth/height of a set/tree.              |
| **Purpose** | Optimize union to avoid deep trees.                  |
| **Usage**   | Union the lower-rank tree under the higher-rank one. |

| Term        | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rank**    | A value representing the tree's height used to optimize union operation |
| **Use**     | Helps avoid tall trees → improves efficiency                            |
| **Related** | Works best with **path compression** during `find()`                    |

- Union Find / DSU (Disjoint Set Union) - Union By Rank | Union By Size | Path Compression
- Union-Find is a data structure that:
- Helps track which elements belong to which group or component supports two main operations:
    - Find(x) → Get the root/representative of the set containing x
    - Union(x, y) → Merge the sets containing x and y

- Real-Life Analogy:
- Think of a classroom where each student belongs to a group.
  Each group has a leader (root).

- Find(x) → Ask: “Who’s the leader of your group?”
- Union(x, y) → Say: “Hey, both of you are in different groups. Let’s merge them under one leader.”

- Trick to Remember:
    - Union = Merge Groups
    - Find = Trace Back to Leader

- **But even being from a Tier 1 college, since my branch is non:** circuital, I wasn't allowed to sit for any IT placements, except one — Dassault Systèmes. The interview lasted 6 hours, and I was the only candidate who had 3 rounds of interviews, unlike others. Everyone thought I would definitely make it, but ironically, they selected 10 others except me. The reason might be that I told the HR that I want to build something of my own in the next 10 years. That innocent answer cost me in this fake corporate world and I got rejected.
- **Now, the fact is that most of my friends are from circuital branches, and my closest friend, who knows up to Linked Lists (and that too very little) and solved nearly 40:** 50 questions, recently got a PPO from Amazon. I still remember I was sitting beside him showing him answers during his interview.
- **I’ve observed that companies like Microsoft, AMEX, Amazon, NatWest, etc., recently have literally hired cheaters from on:** campus. They have no idea how bad some of the selected candidates are.
- **During the very end of placement season, I cracked a core company on:** campus with an 8 LPA CTC. It was a mass hiring, and I had no other option so I applied. Even my family didn’t want me to join service-based companies like TCS, Infosys, and I myself didn’t want to go there either. I’ve seen the struggle of the last 22 years, and I don’t want to put all this knowledge into any mass-hiring company.
- **You think, would you switch into TCS, infosys with package of 3.3:** 7 LPA while you have a job of 60k per month in your own state.
- **And if you're reading this, you should know how screwed up my college is. It follows a "one student, one job" policy — but not for circuital branches. WTF. I still remember that circuital students, especially girls (I’m not gender:** biased, I truly believe in feminism), were allowed multiple offers — BNY, AMEX, and still sat for Amazon, Apple, because there were more companies than students in their case. One girl even failed to reverse a string in a Salesforce interview — she was from CSE.

Additional info:
- I am from a Tier 1 college, a recent graduate with good programming knowledge. I am an ICPC regionalist, have a 1700 Codeforces rating, and have solved more than 600+ questions on LeetCode (just for your reference on how good I am on a scale).
- You guys have even no idea.. how i have seen my life. The struggle i have put up is like hell. I did not even made any relationship thinking it might hamper my career and all  those with so called GenZ and multiple relationships clubs bars are into MNCs. Now how would you belive god... huh ?? These are making me atheist. But Still I belive cosmos broke you before make you. Ok leave this.
- Now, you might say it’s my fault I didn’t get into a circuital branch. For your reference, I got 97.8 percentile, and I am a pure general category student. My father had no clue about this EWS certificate, otherwise people being general with EWS got EE, EC, EI with 96.6 percentile at my college. Most CSE guys had 99.99 percentile, and all were from Bihar. Their percentile trend was like 6 percentile, 43 percentile, 99.99 percentile — how? Complete scam. They don’t even know log(x), e^x, etc.
- Now I’m messaging and cold emailing a lot on LinkedIn, but haven’t gotten a single response. What should I do, guys? Please suggest.

## Full Content

I’m a final-year undergrad at one of the top 3 IITs in a core (circuital) branch. From the outside, it might seem like I’m in a great place, but honestly, I’ve been struggling.

My CPI is in the 7.5–8 range, and I wasn’t able to land a summer internship, while most of my friends got into top companies. I know I slacked off at times, and now I’m feeling really underprepared for placements.

Doing a master’s doesn’t feel like a viable option as opportunities in India aren’t better, and going abroad is out of reach financially and academically (my CPI isn’t strong enough for scholarships or top schools).

Would really appreciate any honest advice from someone who’s been through something similar. How did you deal with it? What helped you get back on track?

Thanks in advance.

I got an on-campus placement oppurtunity in a core company cause my branch is core branch. so i did not get much interview chance to join in software company.
Currently i have strong DSA + CP skills and good projects.

I am fresher and 2025 passout, have not joined in core company. still preparing hard for off-campus. my joining is in mid-july.

What should i do ?? I dont know if i ever get any chance for interview in a good software company. But one AMAZON recruiter has asked me that she will let me know when the fresher hiring will start.

Does it matter in interview that i have not placed in software company.

And what are my chances in this job market ??

🎓 Background
- 2024 graduate from a Tier-I college with a Circuital branch.
- Good in DSA, currently learning LLD, and have done backend-focused projects.
- Current CTC - 16LPA

Career Journey so far
First Offer (On-Campus): Analyst role (Data Science-focused, SBC), but joining delayed by 4 months.
During the delay, applied for few SWE backend roles.

Joined SBC after 2 months Got another offer from a banking company for a SWE role, but was placed in a Data Engineer team instead.

Took the offer out of urgency

**Current Challenges (6 months in)**
- Minimal learning, low workload.
- Worked on: Java-based automation framework, basic full-stack MVP web tool, some work on Data

Experience feels too scattered, not enough depth.

**Current Dilemma – What’s Next?**
1: Transition to Backend SWE

- Passionate about backend, Good at DSA + LLD in progress.
- But resume may not stand out due to diverse past roles.

2: Commit to Data Engineering

Upskill in DE. Accept DE as a focused path and build expertise.

3: Internal switch to backend

Possibility exists, but unlikely to get meaningful work even if it happens.

Advice needed on -
Which path gives the best long-term growth?
Is it worth trying to pivot to backend SWE now, or should I double down on DE?

Preferences - Learning Curve > Pay >>>> WLB

I'm asking this on behalf of my friend.
She is a recent 2025 graduate from the Computer Science branch. She has received an on-campus offer for the role of Associate Software Engineer with a CTC of ₹4.5 LPA. The joining is scheduled for next week, but she is unsure whether she should accept it or not.

The company has a bond of 1.5 years, and breaking it requires a penalty payment of ₹1 lakh. Additionally, there's a 3-month notice period. If she leaves before the bond period ends, she won’t be provided with an experience letter—only a relieving letter will be issued.

Another concern is the daily commute, which would take around 4 hours. She's worried that the long notice period and bond might trap her in the job and make switching difficult later on. However, she is also afraid to let go of this offer due to the current job market situation, especially for freshers, and is uncertain if she will be able to secure another job soon.

She is feeling really confused and would appreciate any suggestions on what might be the best decision in this situation.

**Software Developer Interview Experience**
(0.5–1.5 Years of Experience)

This interview experience is of my student who recent cracked off-campus SDE Offer from Visa - targets software developers with approximately 6–18 months of industry exposure.

In his words -

**The process consisted of four rigorous rounds (1 online assessment + 3 offline technical interviews), all of which (except the OA) were conducted in-person on the same day — making it both mentally and physically challenging.**

**Round 1: Online Assessment (OA)**
**Conducted on a popular platform, the test had 4 algorithmic questions with equal weightage and a 90-minute timer. The difficulty was progressively ramped up:**

The initial problems were deceptively simple, involving fundamental data structures like arrays, stacks, and string manipulation — but solving them efficiently within tight time bounds required clarity and speed.

The third problem tested your implementation stamina — it involved simulating a real-world transformation scenario. While the idea behind it was not complex, translating it into clean, bug-free code under pressure was a different story.

The final problem required advanced algorithmic thinking, specifically around optimized pattern searching — naive methods simply wouldn’t work due to time constraints. Efficient approaches involving classic text-search algorithms were necessary.

Candidates were expected to not just solve, but write production-grade code with optimal complexity and complete all hidden test cases.

What I submitted:

Two complete and optimized solutions.

A partial implementation for the third. But later passed it fully

A brute-force attempt for the last one (which passed ~50% test cases) - But later passed it fully with 100% test cases.

Round 2: **Deep-Dive Technical + CS Fundamentals**

**Duration: 50–60 minutes.**

This round began with a discussion around real-world work experience, project ownership, and decision-making processes. Then followed:

Core DBMS concepts, but not in isolation — the interviewer asked to connect relational theory with use-cases from my current work.

DSA question whose solution was based on greedy + sorting - but had to implement actual sorting. Merge sort: not only an explanation, but also a step-by-step dry run on paper with edge case walkthroughs, followed by code implementation from scratch.

Core OOP principles — but with a twist: the interviewer expected explanations of design choices, not just textbook definitions.

Coding a custom stack using encapsulation — ensuring class design adhered strictly to access modifiers and abstraction principles.

**Round 3: Problem Solving + SQL Integration**
Duration: ~55 minutes.
This round focused on code quality and real-world modeling:

I was given a complex data-processing challenge involving multiple collections, with expected use of Maps and Priority Queues. Edge cases were emphasized heavily.

After that, a relational data operation was presented, where I had to write and optimize a SQL query across two tables.

Final task: a coding problem combining map structures and set-based intersection logic — required both accuracy and speed.

Interviewers here paid close attention to naming conventions, loop boundaries, null handling, and dry-run verification.

**Round 4: System Thinking + Behavioral + Technical Deep Dive**
Duration: ~60 minutes.
This was a combined technical + hiring manager round. The interviewer began with:

Discussion of past project delivery, real-time collaboration models, and personal ownership in ongoing or past initiatives.

Code snippets were presented (involving threads, memory models, and polymorphism), and I was expected to predict the output, explain the behavior, and discuss best practices.

A standard data structures challenge (focused on cyclic behavior) was given — but I had to implement it while justifying each logic branch and edge condition.

Two behavioral questions assessed decision-making, ethical reasoning, and cultural alignment.

**Key Takeaways:**
Expect no hand-holding — you must connect theoretical concepts with production-level coding.

Prepare to share your dry-runs, thought process, and edge-case validation live, not just the final answer.

For every problem, you may be asked to explain alternative approaches and justify time/space trade-offs.

Always be ready to send sample inputs, expected outputs, and custom test cases when asked.

Keep your calm, and don’t rush just to show confidence — precision matters more than speed in face-to-face rounds.

- **Screening round:** DSA - Two easy questions. Solved both.
- **Had next four rounds on the same day:** Super Day. Initially they scheduled 3 rounds, post the result they scheduled the 4th one in evening.
- **Round1:** 2 DSA problems, both around trees. One medium other one LC Hard(Both were on BST, had some discussions around 1st question on optimizing return , the other one involved finding LCA and some further solving).
- **Round2:** 1 LLD and questions around HLD - This round wasn't that great for me (fumbled a bit in few HLD questions). LLD - LRU cache. The interviewer tried to dig deep in whatever I said, so I chose to not answer questions I was not sure of. HLD was mostly related to how we optimize writes in DB, around replication, archival, scaling and indexing of DB.
- **Round3:** Mostly HLD case study regarding how you would approach a production issue. Had questions aroung my current experience, projects and their HLD and some related questions around possibilites of failure of production.
- **Round4:** Hiring manager round - Was supposed to be a non technical round of 30 mins. Hiring manager still asked some design questions (mostly easy) along with a couple HR type ques. Answered all correctly.
- **Round5:** Behavioral round
- **Verdict:** Got the offer. 36 LPA base + ~10 LPA bonus + 1.6L relocation + ESOP equivalency bonus (of current company for current FY)

I’m looking for advice on the right growth path in my software engineering career. I have 3 years of frontend experience (React.js & React Native) and strong DSA skills (600+ LeetCode problems). I'm about to join a React-focused SDE2 role but also have a strong interest in backend system design (HLD) and want to grow into a more technically well-rounded role over time.

Options I’m Considering:
1. Frontend + Java (Full-Stack Path):
   Stick to frontend at work and invest time in learning Java, Spring Boot, LLD, HLD, and continue with LeetCode. Goal: become a React + Java full-stack engineer.

2. Frontend + Node.js (JavaScript Full-Stack Path):
   Learn Node.js for backend to stay in the JavaScript ecosystem. Focus on full-stack apps (React + Node) and continue DSA prep.

3. Frontend Specialist Path:
   Double down on frontend — system design, performance, SSR/CSR, micro-frontends, etc. Aim to become a frontend architect or specialist in top tech companies.

Priorities -
Compmensation > WLB > Branch Name > Location

I’m a 2025 graduate from NIT Rourkela, belonging to a non-circuital branch. I was wondering does the branch really matter in off-campus hiring, especially for companies like MAANG ?

I have a pretty strong Hold on DSA and currently placed in a good core company but need to switch to software company.

## What DFS means ?:
- DFS stands for `Depth-First Search`, where "Depth" means we keep going deeper into each child node as long as there are children exploring down a path before backtracking.
  It’s like diving deep into one branch of the tree before checking the others.
---
## very Simple Example:
- if we have a graph from `1 to 7` Like This One:
```

       (1)
      /   \
     v     v
   (2)     (3)
    |      / \
    v     v   v
   (4)   (5) (6)
            |
            v
          (7)
```
---

## Let's see how DFS works:

- First, we mark **Node(1)** as visited — that's our starting point.
- Then, we assume we follow the left path to **Node(2)** → from there to **Node(4)**.
- Now we ask: **Did we visit all the nodes?** Nope. So we backtrack.
- Is **Node(2)** already visited? Yes → back again to **Node(1)**.
- Try the other path → **Node(3)** → then **Node(5)** → then **Node(7)**.
- After that, backtrack to **Node(3)** again and try the last child → **Node(6)**.
- We use a stack to track this path.

---

## DFS with Stack (Simulation):

| Step | Stack                  | Action                                               |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | [1]                    | Start at Node(1)                                     |
| 2    | [1, 2]                 | Move to Node(2)                                      |
| 3    | [1, 2, 4]              | Move to Node(4)                                      |
| 4    | [1, 2]                 | Node(4) has no children → pop                        |
| 5    | [1]                    | Backtrack to Node(2) → already visited → pop         |
| 6    | [1, 3]                 | Go to second path → Node(3)                          |
| 7    | [1, 3, 5]              | Move to Node(5)                                      |
| 8    | [1, 3, 5, 7]           | Move to Node(7)                                      |
| 9    | [1, 3, 5]              | Node(7) done → pop                                   |
|10    | [1, 3]                 | Node(5) done → pop                                   |
|11    | [1, 3, 6]              | Move to Node(6)                                      |
|12    | [1, 3]                 | Node(6) done → pop                                   |
|13    | [1]                    | Node(3) done → pop                                   |
|14    | []                     | All nodes visited → DFS finished                     |

>  DFS is all about going as deep as possible first, then backtracking step-by-step — and **stack** is the perfect structure for that.

# HarmonyOS Next: Building Applications with Different Package Names Using Multi-Target Products in One Project

## Introduction

In daily development, manually switching signature files and package names when dealing with **multi-signature** and multi-product build outputs is error-prone and time-consuming. HarmonyOS provides custom hvigor plugins and multi-target product building capabilities. We can use hvigor plugins to dynamically modify project configurations, ensuring that a single codebase can switch between different package names while maintaining core functionality. This allows us to generate customized build products through multi-target product building.

## I. Understanding Multi-Target Product Building

### 1. What is Multi-Target Product Building?

Simply put, multi-target products refer to highly customized output modules. Developers can build different HAP, HAR, HSP, APP, etc., by defining different build configurations to achieve differentiation between products. For detailed customization options, see: https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/best-practices/bpta-multi-target#section19846433183815

### 2. Build Schematic Diagram

![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f227e3cf-45ed-4393-b520-d3d3d9da0e54_1746692723.346313.png)


## II. Implementing Multi-Target Product Building in a Project

*(Source code reference branch: feature/multiTargetProduct)*

### 1. Configuring Multi-Target Product Building

Multi-target product building requires modifying configuration files like `build-profile.json5` and `module.json5` to define different `product` and `target` entries. Developers can specify device types, source sets, resources, and assign different targets to products. The build tool generates targets based on these configurations and combines them into customized products.

#### Configure Signing Configs for Different Projects:

Define `default`, `demo_debug`, and `demo_release` signing configurations for debugging and release builds:

```typescript
"signingConfigs": [
  {
    "name": "default", // Default certificate
    "type": "HarmonyOS",
    "material": { /* ... default certificate details ... */ }
  },
  {
    "name": "demo_debug", // Debugging certificate
    "type": "HarmonyOS",
    "material": { /* ... debug certificate details ... */ }
  },
  {
    "name": "demo_release", // Release certificate
    "type": "HarmonyOS",
    "material": { /* ... release certificate details ... */ }
  }
]
```

#### Define Products with Different Signing Configs:

Each product uses a specific signing configuration to generate 差异化 outputs:

```typescript
"products": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "signingConfig": "default", // Default product uses default certificate
    "compatibleSdkVersion": "5.0.1(13)",
    "runtimeOS": "HarmonyOS",
    "buildOption": { /* ... build options ... */ }
  },
  {
    "name": "products_debug",
    "signingConfig": "demo_debug", // Debug product uses debug certificate
    "compatibleSdkVersion": "5.0.1(13)",
    "runtimeOS": "HarmonyOS",
    "buildOption": { /* ... build options ... */ }
  },
  {
    "name": "products_release",
    "signingConfig": "demo_release", // Release product uses release certificate
    "compatibleSdkVersion": "5.0.1(13)",
    "runtimeOS": "HarmonyOS",
    "buildOption": { /* ... build options ... */ }
  }
]
```

#### Link Products to Targets in HAP/HSP Modules:

Configure targets in `modules` to associate products with build outputs:

```typescript
"modules": [
  {
    "name": "entry",
    "srcPath": "./entry",
    "targets": [
      {
        "name": "default",
        "applyToProducts": [
          "default",
          "products_debug",
          "products_release"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 2. Switching Product Configurations and Output Packages

#### Manual Switching Interface:

![image-20250422101824117.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a84ba00b-bd8b-48fc-b4b1-10a85f9975b5_1746692770.9467006.png)
![image-20250422101824117.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/31b23df9-1fe7-40ad-a06d-17fb5ccf3375_1746692785.9229298.png)



## III. Building Different Package Names and Configurations on Multi-Target Products

*(Source code reference branch: feature/differentPackageConfigurations)*

### 1. Adding Signing and Product Configs for a Second App

#### New Signing Configuration for Second App:

```typescript
"signingConfigs": [
  // ... existing configs ...
  {
    "name": "demo_debug_test2", // Signing for the second app
    "type": "HarmonyOS",
    "material": { /* ... testDemo2 certificate details ... */ }
  }
]
```

#### Define a New Product with Unique Identifiers:

Configure `label`, `icon`, `bundleName`, and `output` for differentiation. Use `buildProfileFields` for custom parameters:

```typescript
"products": [
  // ... existing products ...
  {
    "name": "products_debug_test2",
    "signingConfig": "demo_debug_test2",
    "compatibleSdkVersion": "5.0.1(13)",
    "runtimeOS": "HarmonyOS",
    "label": "$string:app_name_test2", // Second app's name
    "icon": "$media:app_icon_test2", // Second app's icon
    "bundleName": "com.atomicservice.6917571239128090930", // Second app's package name
    "buildOption": { /* ... build options ... */ },
    "output": { "artifactName": "products_debug_test2" } // Unique output directory
  }
]
```

### 2. Implementation Results After Configuration

#### Output Product Information:

![image-20250422101824117.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/33fca6c3-c480-44ff-8087-8fc36637b3f3_1746692820.3419456.png)


Desktop icon and application name after it takes effect:

![image-20250422111847105.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/7193570b-817e-47b7-8686-26666396f25a_1746692827.6126914.png)


### 3. Querying and Using Custom Constants

Use `buildProfileFields` to define product-specific parameters for code differentiation.

#### Configure Custom Constants in Products:

```typescript
"products": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "buildOption": {
      "arkOptions": {
        "buildProfileFields": {
          "isStartNet": false,
          "isDebug": true,
          "productsName": "default"
          // ... other custom parameters ...
        }
      }
    }
  },
  // ... repeat for other products with unique values ...
]
```

#### Access Custom Configs in Code:

![image-20250422111847105.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/578edf7b-e823-41ab-88b5-ee7fb86325e9_1746692842.2724106.png)


Import `BuildProfile` and use parameters in UI:

```typescript
import BuildProfile from 'BuildProfile';  
Column() {  
  Text(`productsName:${BuildProfile.productsName}`)  
  // ... other Text components for custom fields ...  
}  
```

#### UI Display of Custom Parameters:

![image-20250422114531440.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/bdfbbfb9-b421-4c60-a801-5765a357026a_1746692849.4196808.png)


## IV. Conclusion

Multi-target product building allows rapid switching between different build configurations and solves package name differentiation for scenarios like multi-entity app submissions (e.g., domestic vs. foreign entities on AG). While this covers basic customization, advanced needs (e.g., dynamic `client_id`/`app_id` in `module.json5`) require integration with **hvigor plugins**. Future articles will explore using custom scripts to modify hard-coded configurations during builds.

## Full Content

Most JavaScript LeetCoders obsess over Array.sort() tricks or sneaky memoization, yet two quietly powerful ES6 features—typed arrays and bitwise math under the hood—can obliterate constant‑factor overhead on a surprising number of “Medium” and even “Hard” problems. In this post I share the journey from a middling 120 ms “Accepted” to a blistering 22 ms top‑1 % runtime on Subarray Sum Equals K (and three other classics) by exploiting these under‑used tools.

First, we replace vanilla arrays with Int32Array, instantly halving memory and slashing garbage‑collection pauses. Then we tap the fact that any bitwise op forces numbers into a 32‑bit signed integer, letting us skip costly modulo arithmetic and branch‑heavy % checks. A compact, cache‑friendly frequency table becomes feasible, turning an O(n log n) map look‑up pattern into a genuine O(n) pass.

I break down exact V8 profiler screenshots, walk through edge‑case pitfalls (why >>> 0 is mandatory for negatives), and provide drop‑in templates you can paste into the LeetCode editor without polyfills. Finally, I benchmark Node 18 vs. Chrome 121 to show that these gains persist outside the sandbox—meaning interview whiteboards and production alike can benefit. Read on, copy the snippets, and watch your green‐bar stats spike overnight.
